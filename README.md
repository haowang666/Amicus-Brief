# Amicus-Brief

This repo contains my codes for amicus briefs research.

mostly some text mining trials

Oct 17 notes:
if you cant download the MSword documents of the cases, just download the [cases.zip](https://github.com/haowang666/Amicus-Brief/blob/master/cases.zip) file. it contains all the cases in the MSword format.
