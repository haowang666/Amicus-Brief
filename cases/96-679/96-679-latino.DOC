\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF) is a national civil rights organization established in 1967. Its principal objective is to secure, through litigation, advocacy, and education, the civil rights of Lations living in the United States. The defense of lawful voluntary affirmative action programs is in the best interests of the Latino community, and MALDEF has taken strong positions in support of affirmative action in employment and in education through all of our activities. MALDEF has also litigated numerous cases under Title VII since the organization's founding; preserving the right of Latinos to be free of discrimination in all aspects of employment is a major goal of MALDEF's Employment Program. Thus, MALDEF has a strong interest in this case.

\par \pard 
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In ruling in favor of respondent Sharon Taxman, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals erred by failing to analyze together the two parts of the test for affirmative action plans under Title VII established in United Steelworkers of America v. Weber, 443 U.S. 193 (1979). In light of the very broad anti-discrimination purposes of Title VII, the legality of an affirmative action plan's "purpose" can only be assessed in light of the burden on non-minority interests - a co-equal concern of Title VII's architects - as well as by considering \b \i0 \ul0 [*3]\b0 \i0 \ul0   all of the circumstances under which the plan was applied. The legislative history of the statute and the evolution of the Weber test itself support the application of this balancing approach to the two parts of the test.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Under the proper test for burden on non-minority interests - the amount of effort required of a white employee to avoid any adverse effect of the affirmative action plan - the Board's plan only minimally trammels non-minority interests. Had the Court of Appeals properly considered this issue, as well as the confluence of other circumstances involved in this case - the absence of minority representation in the Business Department faculty, the unique historical and continuing role of public schools in sustaining or preventing racial discrimination and prejudice, and the equal qualifications of Taxman and Williams - the Board's action would have been upheld. Even though the Board conceded its plan was not "remedial" of any imbalance in its overall workforce, these circumstances, including the minimal burden, demonstrate that the plan is "remedial" in the sense envisioned by the purposes of Title VII.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 ARGUMENT\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 I. The Court of Appeals Erred By Failing\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b \i0 \ul0 [*4]\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b \i0 \ul0  to Address the Two Parts of the Weber Test As A Balance in a Coordinated Appraisal of All of the Circumstances.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In ruling in favor of respondent Sharon Taxman, the en banc Third Circuit Court of Appeals correctly noted that the Court's decision in United Steelworkers of America v. Weber, 443 U.S. 193 (1979), establishes a two-part test to determine whether a race-conscious affirmative action plan satisfies Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \'a7 2000e et seq. Plan purposes must "mirror those of the statute," and the plan must not "unnecessarily trammel the interests of the white employees." 443 U.S. at 208.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 However, the Court of Appeals erred by treating the two parts of the test as mutually exclusive, rather than as reinforcing one another. In assessing the two parts of the test atomistically, the court failed to examine together all of the circumstances surrounding the Board of Education of the Township of Piscataway's (Board) application of its affirmative action plan to the layoff decision involving Sharon Taxman and Debra Williams. Proper assessment of the legality of an affirmative action plan under Title \b \i0 \ul0 [*5]\b0 \i0 \ul0   VII requires a coordinated review of all of the circumstances surrounding its application and a considered balancing of the two parts of the Weber test.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Because it divorced its assessment of the purpose of the Board's action from its analysis of the effect on the interests of non-minorities, the Court of Appeals took a much too narrow view of the acceptable purposes of a lawful affirmative action plan, concluding that only a single purpose - remedying the Board's own discriminatory employment practices - could possibly sustain the plan. Not surprisingly, the Board conceded, consistent with its narrow proprietary interests as an employer, that its plan lacked a "remedial" purpose in this highlyrestricted sense of the term. However, this Court has never held that the purposes of an affirmative action plan must fall within this narrow arena, and nothing in Title VII itself would suggest such a restrictive view of voluntary "remedy."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 A. The Legislative History of Title VII Reveals an Interactive Balance of Objectives - To Eliminate Historical Patterns of Discrimination While Protecting Non-Minority Rights.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In fact, Congress had very broad anti-discrimination purposes in mind \b \i0 \ul0 [*6]\b0 \i0 \ul0   in enacting Title VII - "to endeavor to eliminate, so far as possible, the last vestiges of an unfortunate and ignominious page in this country's history," Weber, 443 U.S. at 204 (quoting Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 418 (1975)), and "to break down old patterns of racial segregation and hierarchy." Weber, 443 U.S. at 208. The Congress acted in pursuit of a "goal of eliminating the lasting effects of discrimination against minorities." Johnson v. Transp, Agency, 480 U.S. 616, 649 (1987) (O'Connor, J., concurring in the judgment). With an eye toward this historical and continuing pattern of racial oppression, the Congress sought to improve significantly the condition of racial minorities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Moreover, these ambitious purposes are national in scope; Title VII aims to change American society as a whole, even while its proscriptions focus specifically on the actions of individual employers. As the House Judiciary Committee stated:
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0 Discrimination continues to exist in all parts of the country. More positive and enduring steps must be taken, therefore, to cure this evil and before racial unrest eats irretrievably into \b \i0 \ul0 [*7]\b0 \i0 \ul0   the body of the American industrial system.
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 H.R. Rep. No. 914, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 2, 29 (1963). Indeed, in its en banc decision here, the Court of Appeals recognizes the breadth of Title VII's purposes, characterizing one of the aims of the statute as "remedy[ing] the segregation and underrepresentation of minorities that discrimination has caused in our Nation's work force." 91 F.3d at 1557 (emphasis added).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Such broad statutory anti-discrimination purposes - wide-ranging in both substantive aim and geographic scope - could support an equally broad range of plans directed at eliminating the effects of pervasive historical and continuing discrimination against racial minorities. Virtually any affirmative action program, crafted with a cognizance of our ongoing national history of racial discrimination against minorities, would "mirror" these quite expansive purposes of Title VII. Still, while all might fall under this broad rubric, not all affirmative action plans satisfy Title VII.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The more specific purposes of affirmative action programs may reflect any number of "remedial" aims, ranging from making whole the victims of specific, documented, and proven \b \i0 \ul0 [*8]\b0 \i0 \ul0   instances of direct discrimination to remedying the most indirect and undifferentiated (though undeniably extant) effects of generalized historical discrimination. While the entire range of such "remedies" is certainly consistent with the broad purposes of Title VII described above, not all affirmative action programs satisfy the statute; this Court obviously had some greater restriction on permissible race-conscious affirmative action in mind in deciding Weber. Fixing where, on this full spectrum of "remedial" aims, affirmative action programs pass from lawful to unlawful is a difficult, and as yet incompletely defined, task.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Fortunately, the legislative purpose and history of Title VII provide additional guidance -- in the evident legislative concern for the right of non-minority employees and applicants to be free of unfair practices taken in pursuit of the broad anti-discrimination aims of the law. Congressional solicitude for this issue emerges both in section 703(j) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \'a7 2000e-2(j), which eschews any intent to require preferential treatment due to racial imbalance, as well as in the comments of legislators that led to the inclusion \b \i0 \ul0 [*9]\b0 \i0 \ul0   of that provision. See Weber, 443 U.S. at 205-07 (describing remarks of Title VII opponents). The concern also appears in the "uncontradicted legislative history" that Title VII protects whites from racial discrimination in employment just as it does minorities. See McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co., 427 U.S. 273, 280 (1976).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Thus, along with its obvious concern about eliminating the historical scourge of discrimination against minorities, Congress also evinced an abiding concern about the rights of non-minorities. To suggest that one of these concerns inevitably outweighs the other in every circumstance would be unfaithful to the legislative history and intent of this landmark legislation. Both concerns were paramount in the minds of the architects of Title VII.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Consistency with this dualistic legislative intent requires recognizing that reconciling the two sometimes conflicting concerns of the legislation involves a balance peculiar to the specific circumstances involved. "Congress . . . balanced these two competing concerns" in choosing to permit certain affirmative action programs while barring others.  Johnson, 480 U.S. at 649 (O'Connor,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*10]\b0 \i0 \ul0   J., concurring in the judgment). In assessing specific affirmative action plans, a similar balance must be struck through a coordinated appraisal of the plan in relation to both concerns; isolated consideration would inevitably accord one interest or the other an inappropriately lesser role.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 B. The Weber Test Envisions a Coordinated Review of Both Parts Through Attention to All Attendant Circumstances.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Court's decision in Weber acknowledges and incorporates both of the key legislative concerns in its two-part test; the first prong responds to Title VII's clear attention to the national phenomenon of entrenched discrimination against minorities, while the second prong, guarding against unnecessary trammeling of non-minority interests, accommodates the law's concern for the rights of whites. In constructing the two-part test, "the Court balanced two conflicting concerns" -- the very same oft-opposed concerns reflected in the legislative history.  Johnson, 480 U.S. at 649 (O'Connor, J., concurring in the judgment).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The very nature of a "balance" does not permit atomized attention to one side apart from the other. Each side of a balance affects its opposite;  \b \i0 \ul0 [*11]\b0 \i0 \ul0   alteration in the weight of one changes the posture of the other. The Weber test involves such a balance. Thus, the second part of the test informs the first; only by a comprehensive and coordinated review of both parts as they apply to a particular affirmative action plan and its application can a court come to a well-informed conclusion about the acceptability of the plan.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Thus, in Weber itself, the Court did not approach the two parts of the test atomistically; instead, it reached a conclusion that closely linked the two. Similarly, in Johnson, while the Court addressed the Weber parts sequentially, there was no strict boundary between them. Even more telling, in the closely analogous context of constitutional limitations on affirmative action, the two key tests - involving the interest served by government action and the tailoring of that action - are directly linked, as the latter inquiry seeks to measure "the degree to which the means employed, 'fit[s]' the ends pursued." Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ., 476 U.S. 267, 287 (1986) (O'Connor, J., concurring in part). A parallel formulation in the Title VII context would directly compare the harm to white interests \b \i0 \ul0 [*12]\b0 \i0 \ul0   in the means adopted by a plan to the specific purpose or end served by the affirmative action plan under scrutiny. Cf. id. (merging the constitutional and statutory tests).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Thus, plans that have the greatest effect on white employees must be supported by a by a "remedial" purpose that is very concrete, particular, and well supported, while "remedial" purposes of less specificity could appropriately support plans that trammel non-minority interests only minimally. For example, an interest in remedying undifferentiated general discriminatory patterns cannot support a program of strict quotas even though that "remedial" purpose is entirely consistent with the broad anti-discriminatory aims of Title VII. Conversely, a program of targeted outreach to minorities need not rest on specific, proven discrimination by the specific employer in order to coincide comfortably with Title VII's dual concerns. Thus, determining whether an affirmative action plan is sufficiently "remedial" depends upon all of the circumstances involved, including most specifically the harm to non-minority interests
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Moreover, this this sensible, interactive resolution of the two parts of the Weber test also suggests \b \i0 \ul0 [*13]\b0 \i0 \ul0   that there is no single point, along the range of all "remedial" purposes consistent with the broad anti-discriminatory aims of Title VII, that uniformly separates lawful from unlawful plans. Rather, a balance with the second part of the Weber test means that there can be no universal conclusions about acceptable purposes for affirmative action plans. Only attention to specific circumstances can yield a meaningful determination.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Thus, this Court should make clear that determining whether an affirmative action plan satisfies Title VII depends upon a coordinated review of its consistency with both Weber tests. The Court of Appeals' failure to conduct such a coordinated review here led it to strike the Board's plan because the Board understandably refused to concede that its employment practices either demonstrated or suggested discrimination. The court did so erroneously.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 II. Under the Circumstances, the Board's Affirmative Action Satisfies the Weber Test Even Though It is Unrelated to Direct Discrimination By the Board.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Instead, the Court of Appeals should have considered the entire confluence of circumstances that led the Board to elect to lay off Taxman instead of Williams \b \i0 \ul0 [*14]\b0 \i0 \ul0   in determining whether a purpose unrelated to underrepresentation of African Americans in the workforce at Piscataway High School as a whole can sustain that decision as a lawful exercise of affirmative action. Taken together, these circumstances demonstrate that the Board acted consistently with Title VII even though it concedes that its decision was not "remedial" of any discriminatory actions the Board itself had taken in its specific teacher employment practices. The minimal burden imposed on non-minority interests, the absence of minority representation in the Business Department faculty, the unique historical and continuing role of public schools in sustaining or preventing racial discrimination and prejudice, and the equality in all other qualifications between Taxman and Williams each contributes to this conclusion.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Of these circumstances, the Court of Appeals considered only the first. Yet, while the first obviously has a place of prime importance, each of the other circumstances offers important elements to a conclusion about the appropriateness of the specific "purposes" served by the Board's affirmative action plan and about the ultimate acceptability of the plan under \b \i0 \ul0 [*15]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Title VII. These circumstances contribute to a sense of the character and type of discrimination the plan seeks to "remedy" and the "fit" of the means selected to pursue that remedy. Taken together, these circumstances support the Board's affirmative action in electing to retain Williams.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 A. Analyzed Correctly, the Burden on Non-minority Employee Interests Was Minimal.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Of course, the element of greatest importance in determining the appropriateness and acceptability of an affirmative action decision is the burden imposed on the interests of non-minority employees and potential employees. As noted above, in enacting Title VII, the Congress evinced a particular interest in minimizing this burden. And, Weber provides that a legal affirmative action program must "not unnecessarily trammel the interests of the white employees." 443 U.S. at 208. In concluding that the Board violated this aspect of the Weber test, the Court of Appeals relied nearly exclusively n2 on the fact that the Board took its action in the context of a layoff decision. This undue reliance was erroneous. [ILLEGIBLE WORDS] presumption conclusively and in all circumstances. Certainly, a strict \b \i0 \ul0 [*16]\b0 \i0 \ul0   quota system in hiring could not fairly be said to trammel non-minority interests [ILLEGIBLE WORDS]
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n2 The Court of Appeals also cited the lack of defined objectives and the absence of a date of expiration in the Board's affirmative action plan. However, these attributes hardly affected the decision made by the Board in laying off Taxman at all. The only rationale related to the decision challenged by Taxman was the layoff context. Deciding whether the Board's policy, in general, is too indeterminate to survive in other contexts would require evidence, not produced by Taxman here, of its application in other circumstances.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Simply put, all layoff programs do not have the exact same effect on white employees, though the Court of Appeals would assume that they do. By the court's logic, all programs affecting hiring would similarly be treated as exactly the same in their effect on non-minority interests. Yet, affirmative action programs in hiring obviously differ in how they affect non-minority applicants. A strict quota program that entirely disqualifies non-minority applicants from being hired in particular positions plainly trammels white applicants' interests much more than,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*17]\b0 \i0 \ul0   for example, a program that reaches out to minority applicants through targeted recruitment efforts and then assists them in completing an application. These plainly differing effects on non-minority interests pertain even if, [ILLEGIBLE WORDS] minority is better qualified than the best-[ILLEGIBLE WORDS] white, then the employer will end up hiring the [ILLEGIBLE WORDS] affirmative action pian involved. Thus, whether a particular plan unnecessarily trammels non-minority interests does not turn on how likely the program is to change the outcome that would obtain in its absence.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Instead, what differentiates these hypothetical affirmative action hiring programs in their effect on whites is the weight of the burden imposed upon a white applicant to overcome the adverse effect of the program. No amount of effort can secure a non-minority applicant's selection under the strict quota program. In contrast, under the recruitment program, a non-minority applicant can still secure a position by acquiring qualifications that not only exceed those of all other white applicants but also exceed those of recruited minority applicants as well. Thus, what amount of added effort or achievement \b \i0 \ul0 [*18]\b0 \i0 \ul0   is required to preserve the outcome that would obtain in the absence of an affirmative action program defines a continuum of relative burdens on non-minorities, with strict quota systems and targeted outreach roughly occupying the two extremes. Where an affirmative action plan falls on the continuum largely determines how much the plan affects or trammels the interests of non-minorities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Court's decision in Johnson, which explicates the test for undue effect on non-minority interests, reflects this principle. In Johnson, the Court did not look merely to the outcome of the affirmative action plan (non-promotion), nor did the Court measure how the plan changed the outcome that would have applied in the plan's absence. Instead the Court noted that the plan merely considered gender as one among several factors, and explicitly permitted consideration of all candidates as compared to all others. See 480 U.S. at 638. The Court noted that the plan thus "unsettled no legitimate firmly rooted expectation" of a non-minority employee. n3 Id. The legitimacy and rooting of a white employee's expectation lies in how secure his or her success would be in the absence of an affirmative \b \i0 \ul0 [*19]\b0 \i0 \ul0   action plan - how far ahead of other competitors is his or her position with regard to the job or promotion at issue. The obverse of this measure lies in how far a non-minority employee must go to nullify any possible adverse effects of the affirmative action plan - what efforts or achievements are necessary to regain a position as leading contender for the hiring offer or promotion.
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n3 Of course, Johnson involved a challenge to a program based on gender, so the "non-minority" candidate was actually a male of the same race as the female employee who was promoted. Nonetheless, the principle applies in the context of race-based plans as well.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 These same principles apply in the context of layoffs. Not all affirmative action plans affecting layoffs have an equivalent effect on non-minority interests. And, the measure of those effects lies not solely in the outcome that would have obtained absent the affirmative action program, n4 but primarily in what it takes for a white employee to avoid any adverse effects of the program. Here, that burden was minimal. Because the Board only took race into account when employees were equal in seniority and in all other qualifications, to prevent \b \i0 \ul0 [*20]\b0 \i0 \ul0   the affirmative action program from having any adverse effect on her continued employment, a white employee only needed to acquire a slight edge in any qualification taken into account by the Board. Thus, the program placed only the slightest onus on a white employee to prevent its application.
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n4 Here, of course, that outcome is ultimately unknowable. And, while this program, by raising Taxman's likelihood of layoff from 50 percent to 100 percent, is surely different from a program that raises such probability from zero to 100, comparisons of probability changes ultimately prove unsatisfactory in resolving how much the program affects non-minority interests. Moreover, such a test is inherently variable, since an employee's probability of layoff changes depending on how many employees have the same qualifications. A test that measures the burden placed on non-minorities to render the affirmative action program neutral is constant in different scenarios.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Indeed, the Board's program placed an even lesser burden on white employees than a program, like that in Johnson, that takes race into account as one of many factors, without ranking or weighing those factors. Here, because race \b \i0 \ul0 [*21]\b0 \i0 \ul0   was the very last factor to be taken into account, any edge in any other qualification would deprive the affirmative action program of any effect as to a particular white employee's employment situation. Analyzed appropriately, the Board's affirmative action program placed a minimal burden on non-minority interests despite its application in the layoff context. The Court of Appeals erred in holding otherwise.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In enacting Title VII, "it was clear to Congress that 'the crux of the problem [was] to open employment opportunities for Negroes in occupations which have been traditionally closed to them.'" Weber, 443 U.S. at 203 (quoting 110 Cong. Rec. 6548 (1964) (remarks of Sen. Humphrey)). When Congress amended Title VII in 1972, it did so at a time "when there was a national focus on the need to continue efforts to desegregate educational facilities." Kromnick v. School Dist. of Philadelphia, 739 F.2d 894, 910 (3d Cir. 1984). The legislative history of the 1972 amendments reveals that Congress was concerned about the effect that the exclusion of minorities from public \b \i0 \ul0 [*22]\b0 \i0 \ul0   positions has upon the communities served by those public institutions. In particular, Congress focused on the effect exclusion has in fostering stereotypes and misconceptions among students. Congress viewed public schools as a formidable weapon in preventing future discrimination:

\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0 It is difficult to imagine a more sensitive area than educational institutions, where the youth of the Nation are exposed to a multitude of ideas and impressions that will strongly influence their future development. To permit discrimination here would, more than in any other area, tend to promote existing misconceptions and stereotypical categorizations which in turn would lead to future patterns of discrimination.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Although the 1972 amendments created a strong incentive for public schools to tear-down barriers and open up opportunities for minorities in faculty positions, it took the Board eight more years to hire its first minority teacher, Williams, into the ten-member Business Department faculty. Pet. for Writ of Certiorari at 2-5, Board of Education of Piscataway v. Taxman, (No. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 96-679)\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . In the interim, the Board had been busy challenging \b \i0 \ul0 [*23]\b0 \i0 \ul0   the statewide policy of the New Jersey Department of Education requiring that the racial composition of each classroom reflect that of the community as a whole, a battle it ultimately lost.  Piscataway Township Board of Education v. Burke, 158 N.J. Super. 436, 386 A.2d 439 (App. Div. 1978).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Although the Board embraced the goals of the 1972 amendments only sluggishly, students taking business courses at Piscataway High School had enjoyed the benefits of a diverse faculty for nine years when the Board was faced with the difficult dilemma of opting for a race-neutral method or relying upon its affirmative action plan in choosing between the equally qualified Taxman and Williams. The Board knew that laying off Williams would not simply diminish the benefits of faculty diversity in the high school Business Department, but would wholly extinguish them by creating an "inexorable zero," Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 342 n. 23 (1977), in the department faculty.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 With a long history of exclusion, whether active or passive, of minorities from the Business Department faculty ranks and of active resistance to statewide efforts to improve conditions for racial \b \i0 \ul0 [*24]\b0 \i0 \ul0   minorities in school, the Board sought to prevent a reversion to the Business Department's historical position. It took "remedial" action to prevent the recurrence of a condition that might well have contributed to a perpetuation of the very historical patterns targeted by the Congress - in this case, a pattern of minority absence from business teaching. The Board sought to make its potential "zero" exorable. In doing so, the Board pursued a "remedy" that, under the circumstances presented, is consistent with Title VII.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 C. The Unique Role of Public Schools In Shaping Societal Values Must be Recognized in Evaluating Affirmative Action Plans.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 As the Court has repeatedly recognized, public schools occupy a unique place in our country. "Education has a fundamental role in maintaining the fabric of our society." Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 221 (1982) (surveying cases discussing key role of public schools). While public schooling has an undoubted high worth to each individual child, its cumulative implications are even more significant. Our society essentially consists of a collection of individuals the vast majority of whom spent their formative years in public \b \i0 \ul0 [*25]\b0 \i0 \ul0   school classrooms and on public school playgrounds; thus, this Court has often noted "the importance of education in maintaining our basic institutions." Id.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Public schools are "the primary vehicle for transmitting 'the values on which our society rests.'" Id. (quoting Ambach v. Norwick, 441 U.S. 68, 76 (1979)). Moreover, "these perceptions of the public schools as inculcating fundamental values necessary to the maintenance of a democratic political system have been confirmed by the observations of social scientists." Ambach, 441 U.S. at 77. At least since the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, one of those fundamental values has been disapproval of discrimination against racial minorities and a commitment to end such discrimination. However, just as schools are an important institutional vehicle for inculcating this anti-discrimination value, they also cannot escape responsibility for fostering, condoning, and perpetuating opposite values in favor of such discrimination during the era when racial oppression was pervasive in our nation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In light of this peculiar role of public schools in our society, it is no surprise that schools were the first \b \i0 \ul0 [*26]\b0 \i0 \ul0   site of the Court's half-century stand against state-sanctioned discrimination. In striking down de jure segregation in Brown v. Board of Educ. of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483, 493 (1954), the Court noted that education is "a principal instrument in awakening the child to cultural values." Looking to both the past and the future, the Court could not help but recognize the culpability of schools in maintaining the prevailing pervasive societal values in support of racial discrimination, as well as the unique ability of the schools to change those values throughout the nation. Thus, in an important sense, all of this Court's subsequent special efforts to eradicate discrimination in the schools - including attention to the importance of faculty integration, see United States v. Montgomery County Bd. of Educ., 395 U.S. 225, 235-36 (1969) - flow from this recognition of the unique importance of public schools in shaping the values of society.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In light of this special role of education - and public schools' unique responsibility for the values that prevail today and prevailed in the past in American society - extraordinary efforts both to prevent and to remedy discrimination \b \i0 \ul0 [*27]\b0 \i0 \ul0   in all of its lingering effects have a special relevance in the schools. Some "remedies" that might be too remote or speculative in the private employer context are nonetheless appropriate in the schools. Schools have a special responsibility to shape and to form a future society that rejects all remnants of racial discrimination against minorities. They have an equally clear culpability in - and responsibility to remedy the continued vestiges of perverse values in favor of discrimination. The broad anti-discriminatory purposes of Title VII can readily accommodate this unique feature of our school systems; the range of acceptable "purposes" for affirmative action plans must reflect it as well.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 D. That Taxman and Williams Were Equal in All Relevant Respects Permits Greater Freedom in Remedying Any Indications of Discrimination.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Like the Congress in enacting Title VII, this Court has long recognized, and continues to recognize, the "unhappy persistence of both the practice and the lingering effects of racial discrimination against minority groups in this country." Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 237 (1995). This Court's skepticism in its decisions \b \i0 \ul0 [*28]\b0 \i0 \ul0   regarding affirmative action programs stems not from any failure to recognize this historical and continuing fact, but from the inherent difficulty in measuring the effects of this unfortunate phenomenon of racial discrimination on particular individuals or in specific situations. The cost of estimation error may be an unfair injury dealt a non-minority who is denied some benefit when a decisionmaker overcompensates for the effects of discrimination. Guarding against this possibility while not ignoring the persistence of racial discrimination requires careful balancing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Indeed, were there no danger of injury to non-minorities, it would make good policy sense, subject to little dispute, to recognize that the accomplishments of members of those groups that face pervasive discrimination likely underestimate their abilities and potential. After all, it is logical to assume that minorities' accomplishments would be greater absent the stumbling block of prejudice and discrimination. Despite this undeniable logic, how much of an effect discrimination has had upon an individual minority's accomplishments is an elusive determination, creating the possibility of overcompensation and the consequent \b \i0 \ul0 [*29]\b0 \i0 \ul0   danger of unfair injury to another.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Nonetheless, doubt about accurate measurement of the effects of discrimination does not deny the existence of those effects. Discrimination accounts for something; we simply do not know how much in many circumstances. Cf.  City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 499 (1989) (there is "no doubt" that discrimination has had effects on minorities, but "how many" minority contracting firms or minority medical students there would be in absence of discrimination is "sheer speculation"). Similarly, as to a specific employer, there may be strong indications of discrimination or its lingering effects, but the extreme difficulty of accurately measuring those effects might lead to a wariness about remedying that discrimination; that understandable caution, however, does not negate a strong inference of vestigial discriminatory effects.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Under Title VII, a manifest imbalance or serious underrepresentation of minority group members rises to the level of certainty as to allay concerns about overestimation of discriminatory effects leading to unfair injury. Other indications of probable discrimination or discriminatory effects may be equally \b \i0 \ul0 [*30]\b0 \i0 \ul0   convincing in abstract, but the difficulty of estimating the effects means that these indications cannot support the same affirmative action steps that a severe statistical imbalance could support. The virtue of statistics is their easy amenability to measurement.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Reasonable concerns about overestimation and the possibility of unfair injury in adjusting between individuals of unequal qualifications, however, take on a different character in the context of absolute equality of qualifications. Generally, when two individuals, one, the member of a minority group subjected to the unfortunate phenomenon of discrimination, and the other, the member of the majority population, are equal in all material respects, then quantifying the effect of discrimination is much less important, and the dangers of overcompensation for those effects and of unfair injury diminish to the point of virtual elimination.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Where two individuals are equal in all relevant respects, as is the case here, an employer may assume logically that of the two, the one who faced obstacles of discrimination, has at least some slight edge in ability and potential. Any discrimination or discriminatory effects stemming from the \b \i0 \ul0 [*31]\b0 \i0 \ul0   employer's past practices could have diminished the minority individual's qualifications enough to create a situation of equal qualifications where, in the absence of discrimination, the minority would have some edge.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Thus, while greater indications of discrimination, such as manifest imbalance, would be necessary to conclude that an employer could fairly re-rank unequal competitors, in the context of equal competitors, it is fair for an employer to make a decision on the basis of lesser indications of discrimination. Re-ranking is perilous where the minority group member is less qualified than the non-minority because it is difficult to know whether the absence of discrimination would both close the gap between the qualifications of the two and place the minority at least slightly ahead. But, where the two are utterly equal, even the slightest increase in the minority's qualifications would lead to her selection; thus, the employer need not quantify any effects of discrimination, but merely know that some such effects exist, in order to justify a selection of the minority as better qualified.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Here, the unique role and responsibility of public schools for fostering, condoning, or \b \i0 \ul0 [*32]\b0 \i0 \ul0   eradicating discrimination, as well as the historical total absence and exclusion of minorities from the Piscataway High School Business Department faculty until Williams was hired indicate lingering discrimination that the Board could lawfully remedy in the absence of a danger of overestimating the effects of these indications of discrimination and unfairly harming another. A situation of absolute equality on all measures of qualifications, as existed between Taxman and Williams, eliminates that danger, and should permit an employer to consider the effects of racial discrimination, even if such discrimination is not evidenced by manifest imbalance or other stronger indicators of discriminatory employment practices by the employer itself.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 CONCLUSION
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 An appropriate appraisal of all of the circumstances involved in its decision to layoff Taxman instead of Williams shows that the Board followed an affirmative action plan that satisfies the two-part Weber test. While its purposes did not relate to any racial imbalance in its overall workforce, in light of the minimal burden imposed on non-minority interests, the Board's action was consistent with purposes that were remedial and that \b \i0 \ul0 [*33]\b0 \i0 \ul0   coincide with the aims of Title VII.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 For all of the reasons stated above, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit should be reversed.
