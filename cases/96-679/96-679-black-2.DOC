\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The unfortunate and unique circumstances of this case obscure the fact that diversity-promoting affirmative action can be fully consistent with Title VII. For example, an affirmative action plan designed to preclude the use of race or gender in a hiring, promotion or retention decision enjoys full harmony with Title VII. One of the FCC's programs which seeks to promote diversity in broadcasting and cable television presents a clear-cut illustration.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The FCC's broadcast and cable television equal employment opportunity rules (the "EEO Rules"), which fulfill Congress' goal of promoting diversity of voices in the media, are effectuated through targeted recruitment of minorities and women to encourage their participation in applicant and interview pools, and through race and gender-neutral procedures designed to prevent discrimination \b \i0 \ul0 [*8]\b0 \i0 \ul0   in the workplace. No reverse discrimination allegation has ever arisen or could possibly arise through the application of these rules.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The FCC's experience with equal employment opportunity demonstrates that diversity and nondiscrimination are symbiotic rather than antagonistic goals.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 ARGUMENT\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 A PROGRAM TO PROMOTE DIVERSITY THROUGH TARGETED RECRUITMENT AND DISCRIMINATION-AVOIDANCE PROCEDURES IS CONSISTENT WITH TITLE VII\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 A. The Piscataway School Board's program is sufficiently benign as not to contravene Title VII\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Racial diversity is of paramount importance in education. n2 The extremely rare use of racial diversity to break a tie in a retention decision illuminates no flaw in affirmative action. In twenty years, only once has the School Board's affirmative action plan been applied to a layoff decision. n3 While affirmative action plans must avoid unnecessarily trammelling the interests of nonminorities, n4 it is difficult to perceive how the School Board's plan did so. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n2 The Third Circuit endorsed the School Board's diversity goal even while objecting to its means: 
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li1200\ri600 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li1200\ri600 \sb0 \fi0 We do not reject in principle the diversity goal articulated by the Board. Indeed, we recognize that the differences among us underlie the richness and strength of our Nation ... Although we applaud the goal of racial diversity, we cannot agree that Title VII permits an employer to advance that goal through non-remedial discriminatory measures.

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Moreover, an affirmative action plan aimed at preventing future discrimination does not appear inconsistent with the purposes of Title VII. n5 If, in the future discrimination comes to an end, all or nearly all affirmative action plans can be discontinued.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 When an affirmative action plan is formed so that reverse discrimination is impossible, no conflict with Title VII can arise\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Many laypersons object to affirmative action because they fail to realize that affirmative action plans almost never result in a hiring, promotion \b \i0 \ul0 [*10]\b0 \i0 \ul0   or retention decision based solely on the race or gender of an individual. n6 However, the means used in affirmative action plans vary widely. For example, a handful of programs use quotas to remedy extreme past discrimination. n7 Some programs rely on goals and timetables while prohibiting the use of race or gender in individual hiring, promotion and retention decisions; others use race and gender only as a "plus factor" in employment decisions. n8 Still other plans use race or gender as factors in hiring or promotion but not in the more invasive area of retention. n9 Finally, some plans, such as the School Board's program, use race or gender only to break ties.

\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n6 See Christopher Edley, Jr., Not all Black and White 18 (1996) ("the single most pernicious popular misconception about affirmative action is that it means quotas. Polls show that large majorities are opposed to quotas").

In Paradise, quotas were used to remedy a nearly four-decade history of the "pervasive, systemstic, and obstinate" discriminatory exclusion of Black candidates for promotion. See 480 U.S. at 167.

\par \fs20 \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n9 This Court has recognized that hiring goals "simply do not impose the same kind of injury that layoffs impose. Denial of a future employment opportunity is not as intrusive as loss of an existing job." Wygant, 476 U.S. at 282-83 (1986) (plurality).
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Many affirmative action plans have purposes sufficiently compelling, and use procedures sufficiently benign, to permit an employer to make a hiring, promotion or retention decision based partly on race or gender without offending Title VII. Moreover, a plan that relies on targeted recruitment and discrimination- avoidance procedures is innately harmonious with Title VII because it does not contemplate that an employer would consider race or gender in individual employment decisions. n10
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n10 In Taxman, the Third Circuit reached the question of whether the School Board's plan conflicted with Title VII only because it had first determined "that Taxman has established a prima facie case [of discrimination]" and "that the Board's decision to terminate her was based on its affirmative action policy." Given this context, "the dispositive liability issue ... is the validity of the Board's policy under Title VII." 91 F.3d at 1556.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  \b \i0 \ul0 [*12]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Such a plan expands the pool of qualified individuals eligible to compete for employment. It does not require that a current employee be terminated or replaced, nor does it create an absolute bar to the advancement of current employees. Even opponents of most affirmative action programs agree that recruitment-based programs are lawful and desirable. n11

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This Court has never established "the line of demarcation between permissible and impermissible affirmative action plans." n12 That line cannot easily be ascertained from the narrow vantage point of the extremely unusual facts facing the Court in this case. However, some affirmative action programs, designed to promote diversity, surely fall on the lawful side of that line.  \b \i0 \ul0 [*13]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Irrespective of the Court's disposition of this case, the Court could provide useful guidance to the public, governmental bodies and legislators by noting that Title VII permits an employer to advance diversity through non-remedial, non-discriminatory measures. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n12 Weber, 443 U.S. at 208.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Envisioning a permissible affirmative action program is not difficult. Consider an industry in which minorities and women have historically been underrepresented. The industry is closely knit, so job opportunities are customarily made known by word-of-mouth from a predominately white male roster of employees. n13 Their friends and associates thus enjoy a decisive advantage over other qualified persons. As the courts have long recognized, this practice of word-of-mouth recruiting from a homogeneous employee roster is discriminatory. n14
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n13 Word-of-mouth recruiting relies on "the usual sorts of personnel mechanisms: connections, contacts, friends, cronies, old associates, candidates with powerful sponsors, candidates who 'feel' familiar and comfortable, etc." Edley, supra note 6, at 183.
\par \fs20 \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n14 See, e.g., Reed v. Arlington Hotel Co., Inc., 476 F.2d 693, 724 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 854 (1973).
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  \b \i0 \ul0 [*14]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 One way the government can attempt to cure this type of discrimination - without offending Title VII - is to require companies to target recruitment efforts toward qualified minorities and women. No one has a right under Title VII to be selected from an applicant pool or an interview pool designed to exclude minorities and women. A white male who would have been hired if competing only against other white males recruited by word-of-mouth, but who was not hired because an equally- or better-qualified minority or woman learned of the job as a result of targeted recruitment, has not been deprived of any right owed to him under Title VII.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 When reverse discrimination is impossible under an affirmative action plan, no conflict between that plan and Title VII can arise. For example, a program in which the employer must refrain from discrimination, establish and maintain positive and continuing efforts to recruit, employ and promote qualified women and minorities, and engage in ongoing assessment and refinement of EEO efforts is entirely harmonious with Title VII.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 As shown infra, one of the FCC's programs which seeks to promote diversity in broadcasting and cable television presents \b \i0 \ul0 [*15]\b0 \i0 \ul0   a clear-cut example of affirmative action that is harmonious with Title VII.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 C. The FCC's Broadcast and Cable EEO Rules exemplify a successful program aimed at promoting diversity in a manner consistent with Title VII\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The EEO Rules illustrate the ease with which a diversity-promoting affirmative action program may operate in harmony with Title VII.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The FCC was the first federal agency to require its regulatees to practice nondiscrimination and affirmative action. The EEO Rules have sought to promote minority and female respresentation in the broadcasting and cable television industries without once generating a complaint that any individual suffered reverse discrimination through the operation of the FCC's program.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Since 1970, the broadcast EEO Rule has prohibited discrimination in broadcasting n15 and has required broadcasters to carry out "a positive continuing program of specific practices designed to ensure equal opportunity in every aspect of station employment policy and practice." n16 In 1972, the FCC adopted a similar program for the cable television industry. n17 Subsequently, Congress adopted EEO requirements for television stations and cable television \b \i0 \ul0 [*16]\b0 \i0 \ul0   systems. n18

Indeed, in only two reported cases in the 28 years of operation of the EEO Rules has a licensee acted even on the erroneous belief that the FCC expects it to engage in reverse descrimination. The FCC sharply criticized each licensee's behavior. In Applications of Certain Broadcast Stations Serving Communities in the States of Alabama and Georgia, 95 F.C.C.2d 1 (1983), the licensee hired a white woman as a receptionist with the understanding that she would be replaced when a qualified Black was found. The FCC held that

\par \pard \ql \li1200\ri600 \sb0 \fi0 The licensee may have misconstrued the intent of our nondiscrimination rule . . . . We wish to make clear that particular positions are not to be set aside for any reason that would suggest discrimination . . . we shall require that the licensee submit a revised EEO program which sets forth the steps it proposes to increase the flow of minority job applicants . . . we admonish the licensee to review its personnel policies and practices to assure nondiscrimination in all aspects of its operation.

In Bennet Gilbert Gaines, Interlocutory Receiver for Magic 680, Inc. 10 F.C.C.R. 6589 (ALJ, 1995), the licensee had proposed to reserve the next three vacancies at the station solely for minorities. The Administrative Law Judge ruled that this was "discriminatory on its face and grossly inconsistent with the Commission's EEO Rules." Id. at 6593.

\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 In 1978, the FCC and EEOC signed a case sharing agreement which combines the two agencies' resources to efficiently serve the statutory goals of both. Memorandum of Understanding between the Federal Communications Commissions and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 70 F.C.C.2d 2320 (1978) [hereinafter FCC/EEOC Agreement]. The Memorandum of Understanding states that "both the EEOC and FCC share a common goal - the elimination of discriminatory employment policies and practices at broadcasting stations." FCC/EEOC Agreement, 70 F.C.C.2d at 2330, app. B. Under 42 U.S.C. \'a7 2000e-4(g)(1) (1978), the EEOC was required to ensure that the policies of its cooperating agencies are consistent with Title VII. The EEOC expressly cited that provision as a basis for its authority to enter into the Memorandum of Understanding. FCC/EEOC Agreement, 70 F.C.C.2d at 2335.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Thus, the means chosen by the FCC to promote diversity, ensure the effective use of the airwaves and remedy the effects of past discrimination are harmonious with Title VII. This type of affirmative action has the ringing endorsement of the Department of Justice, which views with favor programs whose "objective . . . is to expand the pool of applicants . . . to include minorities, not to use race or ethnicity in the actual [hiring] decision." n45

As shown above, the task of opening "every avenue of . . . opportunity" is not so daunting that it entirely evades solution. Recruitment and discrimination-avoidance programs are examples \b \i0 \ul0 [*33]\b0 \i0 \ul0   of affirmative action plans which present no conflict with Title VII.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Irrespective of the outcome of this case, the Court should hold that an affirmative action program aimed at promoting diversity can be fashioned and operated in harmony with Title VII.
