\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Amici address the following questions in their brief:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 1. Whether the courts below properly adhered to principles of judicial restraint and their responsibility to decide only those issues actually and necessarily presented for decision in a case, when they determined that factual conflicts and ambiguities \b \i0 \ul0 [*2]\b0 \i0 \ul0   in the record were "immaterial" to a determination of the "substantive law being applied" and proceeded to the formulation of an unprecedented and sweeping rule of law on complex issues of great national importance.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 2. Whether the courts below erred in interpreting Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1972, and the intent of Congress, as absolutely precluding any non-remedial consideration of race in public school employment, including considerations that are integral to the content and delivery of instruction or aimed at combating the effects of racial isolation in public education.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 3. Whether the courts below erred in applying the proper legal standard to the facts presented in this case in determining whether Respondent's rights were "unnecessarily trammeled" in connection with the reduction in workforce.

\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 * No counsel for any party had any role in authoring this brief, and no person or entity other than the named amici curiae or their counsel have made any monetary contribution to the preparation or submission of this brief.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), established in 1909, is the nation's oldest civil rights organization. The mission of the NAACP is to promote equality as well as social and economic justice in this country for African Americans and other minority group citizens. Toward this end, the NAACP works to secure increased employment and economic opportunities for them according to their abilities. The NAACP and its attorneys have appeared before this Court in numerous important civil rights cases, as counsel of record, see Brown v. Board of Educ., 347 U.S. 483 (1954); Griffin v. New Kent County School Board, 377 U.S. (1964); Nixon v. Herndon, 273 U.S. 536 (1927), as amicus, e.g., Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ., 476 U.S. 267 (1986), Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967); and as a party, e.g., NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 559 (1958).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law is a nonprofit organization established in 1963 at the request of the President to involve leading members of the bar throughout the country in a national effort to ensure civil rights to all Americans. Through its national office in Washington, D.C., and its several affiliate Lawyers' Committees, the organization has over the past 34 years enlisted the services of thousands of members of the private bar in addressing the legal problems of minorities and the poor in voting, education, employment, housing, municipal services, the administration of justice, and law enforcement.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 One of the issues with which the Lawyers' Committee has been deeply concerned since its founding has been the proper scope of affirmative action. The Lawyers' Committee has represented parties, or has filed amicus briefs, in the following illustrative cases: Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200 (1995); Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. F.C.C., 497 U.S. 547 (1990); City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469 (1989); Martin v. Wilks, 490 U.S. 755 (1989); Johnson v. Transportation Agency of Santa Clara County, 480 U.S. 616 (1987); United States v. Paradise, 480 U.S. 149 (1987); Local 28, Sheet Metal Workers' Int'l Ass'n v. EEOC, 478 U.S. 421 (1986); and Local 93, Int'l Ass'n of Firefighters v. City of Cleveland, 478 U.S. 501 (1986).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc. (LDF), was chartered in 1940 for the purpose, inter alia, of providing legal services free of charge to "indigent Negroes denied their civil rights on account of race or color."" Its first Director-Counsel was Thurgood Marshall. Though established by the NAACP, the Legal Defense Fund has been an independent entity for four decades. See NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 422 (1963) (noting LDF's "corporate reputation for expertness in presenting and arguing the difficult questions of law that frequently arise in civil rights litigation").
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Legal Defense Fund attorneys appeared as counsel of record in significant cases of this Court involving equal employment opportunity, see Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424 (1971); Phillips v. Martin Marietta Corp., 400 U.S. 542 (1970) (per curiam) and education, see Brown v. Board of Educ., 347 U.S. 483 (1954), including Rogers v. Paul, 382 U.S. 198 (1965), which recognized public school students' constitutional interest in a desegregated faculty. LDF has also participated in numerous cases arising from voluntary private and local government efforts to address our racial problems, see, e.g, Washington v. Seattle School District No. 1, 458 U.S. 457 (1982); United Steelworkers of America v. Weber, 443 U.S. 193 (1979).

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This case arises from a single employment action: the 1989 layoff of Respondent, a teacher in the Business Education Department of Piscataway High School, pursuant to a reduction in force. The Petitioner determined that a choice was to be made between Respondent, who is white, and Debra Williams, who is African-American. The proposed choice between Taxman and Williams was premised upon the school district's determinations: 1) that the reduction in force should be accomplished by laying off a teacher in the Business Education Department, rather than through a layoff elsewhere and transfer out of that department; 2) that the reduction in force should occur among teachers of "secretarial studies" rather than "business education"; 3) that both had precisely equal seniority; and 4) that both were of precisely equal qualifications. To break the "tie" between the two, the Superintendent proposed and the Board invoked an "affirmative action policy," which provided that:
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0 In all cases, the most qualified candidate will be recommended for appointment. However, when candidates appear to be of equal qualification, candidates meeting the criteria of the \b \i0 \ul0 [*7]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Affirmative Action program will be recommended.
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Accordingly, Taxman was informed that her employment was terminated. n1
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n1 Prior to the layoff, the Department employed ten teachers, including Taxman and Williams, then its only African-American teacher and, apparently, the first nonwhite person to have taught in the Department.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In 1992, the United States instituted this action alleging that Petitioner's layoff of Taxman was unlawful employment discrimination in violation of \'a7 703(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \'a7 2000e et seq. Respondent intervened under 42 U.S.C. \'a7 2000e-5(f)(1), filing a complaint asserting claims under the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination (LAD), N.J.S.A. 10:5:1 et seq., as well as Title VII. No constitutional claim was raised.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In challenging the Board's decision, Taxman asserted that: 1) the choice presented between her and Williams had been manufactured when the designation of the position to be eliminated was changed from "business education" to "secretarial studies"; n2 2) her seniority was, in fact, greater than that of Williams under applicable state law; n3 3)  \b \i0 \ul0 [*8]\b0 \i0 \ul0   that the Board did not act for the purpose of "educational diversity"; n4 4) the Board considered and could have accomplished the reduction in force by laying off a white teacher less senior than both Taxman and Williams and transferring another teacher out of the Business Education Department. n5 Conflicting evidence on these issues was developed in discovery and the district court determined that it was in a position to decide state law questions bearing on the resolution of these claims.
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n2 Taxman had been certified to teach all business education classes since her hire; Williams was initially certified to teach only "secretarial studies" and "typing" until her certification in business education in 1985. See P79 (DA 93); P86 (DA 95); N.J.A.C. 6:11-6.2.
\par \fs20 \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n3 Taxman maintained that Williams improperly had been credited with seniority for time absent for medical reasons, see N.J.A.C. 6:3-1.10(b). The district court held that prior administrative determination of the seniority question, see Taxman v. Piscataway Township Bd. Of Educ., No. EDU 5063-89 (Office of Administrative Law, May 2, 1990); Taxman v. Piscataway Township Bd. Of Educ., (Commissioner of Education, June 15, 1990), would not be given preclusive effect in deciding this case.  798 F. Supp. 1093.

\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n4 Taxman argued that there was no evidence that the Board acted for that purpose.  832 F. Supp. at 848 n.9.

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 As to the district's affirmative action policy, the record discloses that the Board adopted a "program" in 1975, pursuant to a New Jersey State Department of Education regulation requiring school districts to implement plans providing for "affirmative action" in both their employment and classroom practices, see N.J.A.C. 6:4-1/3(b)(1) (1997), promulgated to effectuate both a State mandate that localities not maintain racially isolated public schools, see Booker v. Board of Educ. of Plainfield, 45 N.J. 161, 212 A.2d 1 (1965); cf. (DA 70) and Congress's instruction, in Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. \'a7 1681(a) (1994), that educational institutions receiving federal funds not discriminate on the basis of sex. Notably absent from the 1975 Program -- despite its length and detailed attention to issues of minority and female participation in Petitioner's workforce -- is any express recognition of gender or ethnic diversity as a consideration in employment decisions, of the importance \b \i0 \ul0 [*10]\b0 \i0 \ul0   of such diversity within particular departments of a school, or of the educational benefits students derive from being taught by a diverse departmental faculty.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In 1983, the Board adopted an additional one-page "policy," (DA 53), which affirms a commitment to "ensure equal employment opportunity for all persons and prohibit discrimination in employment because of sex, race, color, creed, religion, handicap, domicile, marital status, or national origin," and indicates that "this program of equal employment opportunity and affirmative action shall be an integral part of every aspect of employment, including. . . transfers, recruitment . . . layoffs . . . promotions and tenure." Neither the lengthy 1975 Program nor the brief 1983 sequel mentions "diversity."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Beyond the text of the affirmative action plan, in excerpted deposition testimony made a part of the record, Board officials and employees explained how they understood affirmative action considerations to have affected the layoff decision. They understood their policies as prohibiting consideration of race or gender in cases where one candidate was more qualified than the other, and that the decision whether to invoke the tiebreaking \b \i0 \ul0 [*11]\b0 \i0 \ul0   provision in any particular instance was entirely within the Board's discretion. See, e.g., Deposition of Theodore Kruse (DA 75).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Reflecting on his participation in the decision, Theodore Kruse, a university professor and Board President at the time testified ". . . I believe by retaining Ms. Williams it was sending a very clear message that we feel that our staff should be culturally diverse, our student population is culturally diverse and there is a distinct advantage to students, to all students, to be made -- come into contact with people of different cultures, different background, so that they are more aware, more tolerant, more accepting, more understanding of people of all background[s]." (DA 75).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 After the close of discovery and a series of pretrial rulings by the district court, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Notwithstanding the factual disputes on the several issues related to the personnel decision of the Board, discussed above, the parties sought summary judgment based largely on a set of stipulations set down in the district court pre-trial order. n6
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n6 These include acknowledgment that "minorities" were not "underrepresented" in relevant job categories of Petitioner's work force at various times pertinent to the case; that the Board had not adopted its policies for "the purpose of remedying any prior discrimination [on its part], or for any remedial purpose" (P64), and that Petitioner had not acted with a "specific intent to remedy any prior discriminatory act, practice, or pattern in the School District."
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  \b \i0 \ul0 [*12]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The district court did not examine nor consider any of the disputed factual issues, except for the dispute as to whether the Board's asserted basis for its action -- "educational diversity" -- was, in fact, the basis on which it intended to act. The court found resolution of that factual dispute unnecessary "in light of the court's conclusion that the purpose asserted, even if factually supported, does not constitute a legal justification for the Board's" action.  832 F. Supp. at 848-49 n.9. The court determined that because this Court's decisions in United Steelworkers v. Weber, 443 U.S. 193 (1978), and Johnson v. Transportation Agency of Santa Clara County, 480 U.S. 616 (1987), went no further than approving affirmative action plans premised upon "manifest imbalance" in a traditionally segregated job category, see Johnson, 480 U.S. at 631-32; Weber, 443 U.S. at 197, and in constitutional cases had rejected other asserted bases for affirmative action, "that the Board's plan [wa]s unlawful." 832 F. Supp. at 848.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Third Circuit, sitting en banc, affirmed the judgment of the trial court on grounds no \b \i0 \ul0 [*13]\b0 \i0 \ul0   less sweeping than those relied on below. n7 After summarizing the relevant facts of the Weber and Johnson cases, the appeals court undertook to decide whether, as had been the case with the Kaiser Aluminum and Santa Clara Transportation Agency plans, the purposes animating Petitioner's affirmative action policy could be said to "mirror" those of Congress in enacting Title VII. See 91 F.3d at 1555 (quoting Weber, 443 U.S. at 208). Declaring that Title VII had been enacted to further two (but only two) "primary goals": (1) "to end discrimination . . . thereby guaranteeing equal employment opportunity in the workplace, and [(2)] to remedy segregation and underrepresentation of minorities that discrimination had caused in our Nation's work force," the Court explained that it was only because of this "second corrective purpose" that "affirmative action can co-exist with the Act's antidiscrimination mandate," 91 F.3d at 1557; see also id. at 1558 (that Board's affirmative action violates the "terms of Title VII" is "beyond cavil"). n8
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n7 Apart from acknowledging that the case had been decided on summary judgment and submitted on stipulated facts, 91 F.3d at 1550 n.1, and that, accordingly, "plenary" appellate review was indicated, the Third Circuit did not undertake to grapple with the conflicts and ambiguities in the record, cf.  91 F.3d at 1556 ("for summary judgment purposes, the parties do not dispute that Taxman has established a prima facie case or that the Board's decision to terminate her was based on its affirmative action policy"), undertaking instead to resolve the case by formulating the broadest rule of law that the case arguably implicated.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  \b \i0 \ul0 [*14]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n8 Responding to the dissent's argument that "combatting the attitudes that can lead to future patterns of discrimination" is also consistent with Title VII, the majority said that would be a "dramatic rewriting of the goals of the statute." 91 F.3d at 1558 n.9.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Because Congress had not similarly recognized diversity as "a Title VII objective requiring accommodation," the Court explained, a policy that seeks to advance diversity -- or any other objective other than those upheld in Weber and Johnson -- is a fortiori unlawful under Title VII, 91 F.3d at 1558; see also id. at 1557 ("unless a plan has a remedial purpose, it cannot be said to mirror the purposes of the statute, and therefore, cannot satisfy the first prong of the Weber test").
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Court then turned briefly to Weber's second requirement, that an employer's affirmative action policy not "unnecessarily trammel" nonminority interests, and held the Petitioner's policy deficient in this respect too. After criticizing the Board's policy for its "lack of structure" when compared to the Weber and Johnson plans, the Court held, a layoff is "so severe that the Board's goal of racial diversity,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*15]\b0 \i0 \ul0   even if legitimate under Title VII, may not be pursued in this fashion." While the hiring and promotion goals upheld in Weber and Johnson "impose[d] a diffuse burden, often foreclosing only one of several opportunities, layoffs impose the entire burden of achieving racial equality on particular individuals, often resulting in serious disruption of their lives." Id. at 1564 (citing Wygant v. Jackson Board of Education, 476 U.S. 267, 283 (1986)).

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 TITLE: \b0 \i0 \ul0 BRIEF FOR THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF COLORED PEOPLE, NAACP LEGAL DEFENSE & EDUCATIONAL FUND, INC., AND LAWYERS' COMMITTEE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS UNDER LAW AS AMICI CURIAE SUPPORTING PETITIONER
\par \pard 
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The lower courts issued sweeping, rigid, and unprecedented constructions of Title VII that went far beyond what was necessary to resolve the dispute before them, did so on an inadequate summary-judgment record that left critical questions unanswered, and resolved these complex issues as an alternative to resolving disputed factual questions that could well have made the lower courts' unprecedented rulings unnecessary.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Among these disputed questions were (1) whether the Petitioner actually did rely on educational diversity to justify its layoff of Respondent; (2) the weight of that interest, in the event that Petitioner were found to have relied on educational diversity; and (3) whether \b \i0 \ul0 [*16]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Respondent's claim that it would have been consistent with the seniority system to lay off a less senior white employee was correct, suggesting the absence of any discrimination on the basis of race.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The lower courts' approach violated the principles of judicial restraint and imposed on summary-judgment procedures a burden too weighty for them to bear. The result of their overreaching, unless reversed by this Court, will be to constrict public and private employers in essential functions never brought to the attention of the lower courts, regardless of the records that could be compiled in cases focused on those particular situations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The lower courts erroneously interpreted United Steelworkers v. Weber, 443 U.S. 193 (1979), and Johnson v. Transportation Agency of Santa Clara County, 480 U.S. 616 (1987), as determining the limits of permissible bases for affirmative action, where these cases expressly declined to define the outer bounds. Similarly, the courts below erroneously interpreted Title VII as imposing a more restrictive standard for the permissible consideration of race than even that of the Constitution, a proposition that goes further than would \b \i0 \ul0 [*17]\b0 \i0 \ul0   have the dissent in Johnson, and one that is wholly without precedent in this Court's cases.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 There are strong indications in the legislative history of Title VII that Congress did not intend the broad conclusions reached by the district court. Title VII was not enacted in isolation, but as part of a comprehensive scheme that took into account the interrelationships between discrimination in employment and other forms of discrimination, and designed, as a whole, to accomplish the bringing of African-Americans into the American mainstream. The purposes of Congress are distorted by a holding that Title VII allows affirmative action only as a remedy for the employer's own discrimination.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Indeed, between the original enactment of Title VII in 1964 and the extension of Title VII to State and local employers -- including public schools -- in 1972, Congress enacted significant legislation designed to foster race-conscious teacher hiring and assignment decisions to cure racial isolation and de jure segregation in schools, not only in employment but for the benefit of students. It strains credulity to consider that the same Congress that would encourage such actions was simultaneously amending \b \i0 \ul0 [*18]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Title VII to end such actions.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Any race-conscious layoff plan must meet a standard of justification commensurate with the strength of the employer's interest in preserving diversity and with the burden imposed by the layoff. That burden may be light or heavy, depending on the facts of the case. In all cases, the employer making use of a race-conscious layoff must show that it has considered, and has good reasons for rejecting, less onerous means. This graduated and flexible approach to race-conscious layoffs has in practice meant that they are rare, and will continue to guarantee their rarity.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The lower courts failed to recognize that race was not the only factor that affected the reduction-in-force determination, and failed to weigh either the Board's legitimate diversity interests or the extent to which they could be effectuated only through the means of a racebased layoff under the circumstances of this case. The conclusion that the Board's action "unnecessarily trammeled" Respondent's rights thus lacks an appropriate basis in essential factual findings and must be vacated.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The decision below should be vacated and the case remanded to the district court for the development of \b \i0 \ul0 [*19]\b0 \i0 \ul0   a proper record, the entry of findings on the factual issues, and the determination of any necessary legal questions on an appropriately narrow basis.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 I. THE LOWER COURTS SHOULD NOT HAVE ISSUED SWEEPING CONSTRUCTIONS OF TITLE VII IN THIS CASE, AND ON THIS RECORD
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 A. THE DECISIONS BELOW WENT FAR BEYOND THE NEEDS OF THIS CASE, VIOLATING BASIC PRINCIPLES OF JUDICIAL RESTRAINT\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The lower courts in this case have reached the sweeping conclusion that race-conscious employment decisions cannot be justified by any interest or basis other than to remedy manifest imbalance in job categories. They reached and resolved this question despite the district court's recognition that the question might not even be presented by this case. The district court noted the controversy as to whether there was any factual foundation for the Board's asserted reliance on educational diversity, but held that its broad construction of Title VII made it unnecessary to decide whether there was a genuine issue of material fact on this question.  832 F. Supp. at 848-49 n.9. The court of appeals did not advert to the question, but simply assumed that the school board had shown \b \i0 \ul0 [*20]\b0 \i0 \ul0   that it acted on the basis of educational diversity.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The approach of the lower courts was precisely the opposite of what it should have been. There were many grounds on which the case could have been decided without reaching a sweeping and inflexible construction of Title VII. First, the court should have determined whether there was sufficient evidence to support the Board's asserted justification of "educational diversity." If the Board did not present evidence sufficient to show that it laid off Respondent because it relied on educational diversity, its layoff decision would have been unexplained and judgment could have been entered for the Respondent.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Second, even if the record were clear that the Board did in fact act on the basis of educational diversity, the court should have made findings on the strength of the interest asserted. In the absence of evidence establishing an appropriately weighty interest, the question of the legality of a properly-supported reliance on educational diversity could not arise.  Hayes v. North State Law Enforcement Officers Association, 10 F.3d 207, 210 (4th Cir. 1993), for example, rejected the City of Charlotte's contention that its \b \i0 \ul0 [*21]\b0 \i0 \ul0   interest in effective law enforcement justified the use of a race-based promotion policy to achieve diversity, because "the City has not provided sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment on its claim that racial diversity is essential to effective law enforcement and constitutes a compelling state interest."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Basic principles of judicial restraint counsel against the issuance of a sweeping and inflexible construction of Title VII where the question decided is not necessarily presented by the case and where there are numerous narrower grounds for decision. "In litigation generally, and in constitutional litigation most prominently, courts in the United States characteristically pause to ask: Is this conflict really necessary?" Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 117 S. Ct. 1055, 1072 (1997) (footnote omitted).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 While there is certainly a case and controversy between the parties, this does not mean that there is automatically a case or controversy between the parties on all issues. This Court has cautioned that not even a statute can authorize a Federal court to decide the merits of a legal question not posed in an Article III case or controversy.  U.S. Bancorp Mortgage Co. v. Bonner Mall Partnership, 513 U.S. 18 (1994). \b \i0 \ul0 [*22]\b0 \i0 \ul0   In U.S. National Bank of Oregon v. Independent Insurance Agents of America, 508 U.S. 439 (1993), this Court found that the court of appeals "had before it a real case and controversy extending to that issue." (Emphasis supplied). In the context of holding that a Federal court has jurisdiction to determine whether the law creating the Federal question is in force, this Court sounded a caution that applies with equal force to the case at bar:
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0 The contrary conclusion would permit litigants, by agreeing on the legal issue presented, to extract the opinion of a court on hypothetical Acts of Congress or dubious constitutional principles, an opinion that would be difficult to characterize as anything but advisory.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 "Concerns of justiciability go to the power of the federal courts to entertain disputes, and to the wisdom of their doing so." Renne v. Geary, 501 U.S. 312, 316 (1991). They include consideration of the timing of judicial intervention.  Id. at 320. Where the issues to be decided have "fundamental and far-reaching import," they should not be decided upon an "amorphous and illdefined factual record.  \b \i0 \ul0 [*23]\b0 \i0 \ul0   " Id. at 324. "Rules of justiciability serve to make the judicial process a principled one. Were we to depart from those rules, our disposition of the case would lack the clarity and force which ought to inform the exercise of judicial authority." Id.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 These considerations are of particular importance here. The lower courts did not have before them a well-developed record exploring the importance of racial diversity in education, but chose to issue rulings that would bar all reliance on such diversity in education and in all other types of employment, no matter how well supported a particular program might be.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Seventh Circuit has recently cautioned against such sweeping pronouncements, and has refused to apply the dicta in this Court's opinions in the manner chosen by the lower courts.
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0 But there is a reason that dicta are dicta and not holdings, that is, are not authoritative. A judge would be unreasonable to conclude that no other consideration except a history of discrimination could ever warrant a discriminatory measure unless every other consideration had been presented to and rejected by him. The dicta on which the plaintiffs rely were uttered in cases \b \i0 \ul0 [*24]\b0 \i0 \ul0   that did not involve, by judges who had never had cases that involved, the racial composition of a prison's staff. Such cases were not, at least insofar as one can glean from the opinions, present to the minds of the judges when they considered and rejected other grounds for discrimination and expressed that rejection in the sweeping dicta that we have mentioned. The weight of judicial language depends on context, by these plaintiffs ignored.

The court focused its holding on the special context of penal "boot camps," where "the idea is to give the inmates an experience similar to that of old-fashioned military basic training, in which harsh regimentation, including drill-sergeant abuse by correctional officers, is used to break down and remold the character of the trainee." 87 F.3d at 917. The court held that, in the special circumstances shown by the record there and supported by expert testimony, it was as lawful for the defendants to promote an African American to the rank of lieutenant although he ranked lower on the promotional register than \b \i0 \ul0 [*25]\b0 \i0 \ul0   some white candidates, as it would have been to separate prisoners by race in a prison undergoing a race riot.  Id. at 919.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 For these reasons, we urge the Court to vacate the decisions below and to remand the case for resolution of the factual questions on which any proper interpretation of Title VII must depend, with instructions that the courts should decide the issues in this case on an appropriately narrow basis.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 B. SWEEPING CONSTRUCTIONS OF TITLE VII SHOULD BE BASED ON A FULL RECORD AND ADEQUATE FINDINGS, NOT ON SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND STIPULATIONS\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The district court handed down its broad constructions of Title VII based on its view that the factual issues "need not be decided" in light of these broad constructions.  832 F. Supp. at 848-49 n.9. The parties were largely responsible for the divorce between the decision of this case and a fully developed record; both parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment and agreed to stipulated facts. Just last Term, this Court warned Federal courts not to allow such ready agreements between parties to tempt them into issuing broad advisory opinions: "In advancing cooperation between Yniguez and the Attorney \b \i0 \ul0 [*26]\b0 \i0 \ul0   General regarding the request for and agreement to pay nominal damages, the Ninth Circuit did not home in on the federal courts' lack of authority to act in friendly or feigned proceedings." Arizonans for Official English, 117 S. Ct. at 1070.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This is not an appropriate use of Rule 56, FED. R. CIV. P. In Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255 (1986), this Court affirmed the power of a "trial court to deny summary judgment in a case where there is reason to believe that the better course would be to proceed to a full trial." Kennedy v. Silas-Mason Co., 334 U.S. 249, 257-58 (1948), stated that while the district court has the power to resolve issues on summary judgment, and while the use of that power may be "salutary where issues are clear-cut and simple," summary procedures nonetheless "present a treacherous record for deciding issues of far-flung import, on which this Court should draw inferences with caution . . . ." As in Kennedy, the better course of action here would have been "to withhold decision of the ultimate questions involved in this case until this or another record shall present a more solid basis of findings based on \b \i0 \ul0 [*27]\b0 \i0 \ul0   litigation or on a comprehensive statement of agreed facts." Id. at 257.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 As we have shown above, the record in this case -- including the parties' stipulations -- reflects numerous factual problems, the resolution of which may have made any broad construction of Title VII unnecessary. If the lower courts had agreed with Respondent's claim that she was more senior than Williams, n9 for example, the Petitioner's tie-breaker affirmative-action policy would have been inapplicable and the Respondent would have won her case on State-law grounds not requiring any broad constructions of Title VII. Conversely, if Respondent had succeeded in convincing the trial court of her claim that the reduction in force could have been carried out by laying off a less senior white teacher, she may have had a different claim but not a Title VII claim.
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n9 The Board itself had suggested that this question be referred to the State courts.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Moreover, the lower courts' combination of a thin record and lack of restraint have resulted in the worst possible means of resolving a legal question. Because the employer here put on no substantial evidence of the variety of ways in which a diverse workforce \b \i0 \ul0 [*28]\b0 \i0 \ul0   can be important to employers and no substantial evidence of the intensity of such importance, the lower courts' summary judgment decision will tie the hands of both private and public employers in a wide variety of contexts. A police department covered by Title VII will, for example, remain able to investigate criminal gangs composed of members of a particular racial group by assigning undercover officers to infiltrate the gang, but will be unable to take the race of its officers into account in determining who will best be able to infiltrate the gang.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Similarly, the courts below pronounced this sweeping rule on a record all but devoid of evidence as to school districts' essential interest in determining matters affecting the content and delivery of instruction.
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb120 \fi360 School authorities are traditionally charged with broad power to formulate and implement educational policy and might well conclude, for example, that in order to prepare students to live in a pluralistic society each school should have a prescribed ratio of Negro to white students reflecting the proportion for the district as a whole. To do this as an educational policy is within the broad discretionary powers of school \b \i0 \ul0 [*29]\b0 \i0 \ul0   authorities . . . .

Just as Swann recognized that the assignment of students to the classroom is itself an element of the lesson being taught, so too the choice and deployment of teachers is integral to the instructional content, method, and delivery.
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb120 \fi360 Within the public school system, teachers play a critical part in developing students' attitude toward government and understanding of the role of citizens in our society. Alone among employees of the system, teachers are in direct, day-to-day contact with students both in the classrooms and in the other varied activities of a modern school. . . . Thus, through both the presentation of course materials and the example he sets, a teacher has an opportunity to influence the attitudes of students toward government, the political process, and a citizen's social responsibilities. This influence is crucial to the continued good health of a democracy.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The courts below did not question the existence of educational benefit to public school children of being exposed to a culturally diverse teaching force -- to the contrary, they went out of their way to recognize the reality and importance of such benefit. Rather, purporting to rely on the "words, legislative history, [and] historical context" of Title VII, 91 F.3d at 1557, the Court of Appeals determined that Congress had failed to "recogn[ize]" such diversity as a "Title VII objective" worthy of "accommodation." Id. at 1558. Indeed, the court held that no "nonremedial purpose" -- that is to say, no employer objective other than the correction of manifest workforce imbalance that spurred the programs upheld in Weber and Johnson -- may be reconciled with Title VII. In both its broad and its narrow formulations, and as a matter of "straightforward statutory interpretation," the rule announced by the Third Circuit is error.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The most evident mistake of the Court of Appeals was its reading of this Court's decisions in Johnson and Weber as delimiting the permissible bases for voluntary \b \i0 \ul0 [*31]\b0 \i0 \ul0   affirmative action under Title VII. While both cases announced principles governing challenges to remedial affirmative action, neither Johnson nor Weber provides any support for the appellate court's conclusion that other bases for affirmative action are suspect, let alone illegitimate per se under the Act. To the contrary, the Weber opinion begins by declaring that "The only question before [the Court] is the narrow statutory issue of whether Title VII forbids private employers and unions from voluntarily agreeing upon bona fide affirmative action plans that accord racial preferences in the manner and for the purpose provided in the Kaiser-USWA plan," 443 U.S. at 200, n10 and concludes by declaring: "We need not today define in detail the line of demarcation between permissible and impermissible affirmative action plans," id. at 208.
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n10 The recognition in Weber of the congressional policy favoring preservation of managerial prerogatives to take affirmative action consistent with the objectives of Title VII, see 443 U.S. at 205-06, is equally applicable to an employer's interest in nonremedial objectives.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 To the extent that Weber laid \b \i0 \ul0 [*32]\b0 \i0 \ul0   down rules that must guide determination of the issue presented, they are (1) that Title VII's prohibition on "discriminat[ion]" may not be read literally to bar an employer's taking race into account, n11 a holding to which the court below showed scant allegiance, and (2) that "the prohibition against racial discrimination in [the statute] must [instead] be read against the background of the legislative history of Title VII and the historical context from which the Act arose," 443 U.S. at 201, a rule that the lower court opinion quotes but does not follow. If a gender- or raceconscious employment policy is (1) consistent with congressional purpose, and (2) avoids "unnecessarily trammel[ing]" the interests of nonbeneficiaries, 443 U.S. at 208, Weber and Johnson teach, it does not violate Title VII. n12
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n11 See also Johnson, 480 U.S. at 629 n.7 (noting Weber's "decisive rejection of the argument that the 'plain language' of the statute prohibits affirmative action," as well as subsequent congressional acquiescence); id. at 644 (Stevens, J., concurring) (Weber is "now an important part of the fabric of our law")
\par \fs20 \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n12 The parties and decisions below similarly mistook the significance of the relationship between the constitutional and statutory standards. Whether the holding of Johnson, 480 U.S. at 627 n.6, that Title VII is more permissive than the Constitution, applies only when the affirmative action program is remedial, as was suggested somewhat implausibly below, no opinion of this Court has contended that Title VII imposes a more stringent standard, see, e.g., Johnson, 480 U.S. at 651 (Scalia, J., dissenting)(arguing that Title VII and Equal Protection standards are the same); cf.  id. at 630 n.8 (answering dissent).
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 That, however, is what the decision below does: it held that a race-conscious decision is illegal, irrespective of whether it is narrowly tailored to advance a compelling government interest. On this reading, given the fact that public employees already may state claims under \'a7 1983 and the Equal Protection Clause, the main purpose of Title VII would be to outlaw those practices that would be upheld under strict scrutiny. The Court should not lightly infer such an extraordinary congressional purpose, i.e., one that disables States from achieving objectives of overriding importance (alternative, race-neutral solutions being inadequate to the task, by definition), see City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 507 (1989)), especially in the absence of an exceedingly clear statement.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Court of Appeals' second basic error was its conclusion that the legislative history of the Civil Rights Act is barren of support for any other sort of nonremedial affirmative action. The majority announced that its review disclosed but two objectives in the legislative history of the 1964 Act and its 1972 Amendments extending coverage to state and local government employers, the same two, not surprisingly that had been identified in Weber: the "primary purpose" of prohibiting discrimination and the secondary purpose of countering the effects of past discrimination; nowhere in the "positive legislative history" was there support for the "racial diversity purpose" said to be advanced by Petitioner. This conclusion was doubly mistaken. First, it is untenable to say, as the court of appeals majority assumed, that Congress' concern in 1964 was exclusively with the effects in employment of the traditional patterns of racial segregation and hierarchy," 91 F.3d at 1557-58. Congress' purpose, as Weber properly acknowledged, was the "integration of blacks into the mainstream of American society," and it fully understood that doing so would require a comprehensive approach.  \b \i0 \ul0 [*34]\b0 \i0 \ul0

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The emphasis on the interrelationship of the effects of various sorts of discrimination, the recognition that discrimination in education could have effects on employment -- and that overcoming discrimination in employment would make equality in education or public accommodations meaningful -- helped to convince Congress that a comprehensive approach was needed: the 1964 Civil Rights Act, of which Title VII is one chapter, is the \b \i0 \ul0 [*35]\b0 \i0 \ul0   fruit of that central insight. To say, as the Third Circuit held, that an employer is entitled to take steps to overcome the effects of discrimination in employment, see Weber, 443 U.S. at 202; Johnson, 480 U.S. at 631 n.10, but not in education, would thus be to draw a distinction alien to the 88th Congress.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Of equal gravity is the disregard of the court below of a congressional purpose that permeates the legislative history of the 1972 extension of the Civil Rights Act: its emphasis on the value of minority employees' "participation" in government, not only as a means of economic uplift, but for the purpose of assuring fair treatment of minority communities and enhancing the legitimacy of government institutions in those communities. Thus, while Congress surely did not endorse any rule of proportional representation, its belief that ensuring integrated workforces "in . . . government activities that are most visible to the minority communities (notably education, law enforcement, and the administration of justice)," H.R. REP. NO. 92-238, 92d Cong., 1st Sess. 17 (1971), would prevent "ignorance of minority problems . . . [and] mistrust . . . of government,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*36]\b0 \i0 \ul0   " S. REP.

\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n14 Nor is this insight limited to Congress. See, e.g., Ballard v. United States, 329 U.S. 187, 193-94 (1946)("The truth is that the two sexes are not fungible; a community made up exclusively of one is different from a community composed of both; the subtle interplay of influence one on the other is among the imponderables.

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In addition to neglecting this \b \i0 \ul0 [*38]\b0 \i0 \ul0   evidence that Congress did not conceive Title VII's purposes as cabined to the economic or employment realm, the lower court ignored an element of "historical background" that is even more pertinent to the case at hand. When Congress enacted legislation extending Title VII to State and local governments -- and thus to public school teachers -- it did so in the midst of the vast transformations in public education, both court-ordered and voluntary, undertaken in response to this Court's decisions in Brown v. Board of Educ., 349 U.S. 294, 301 (Brown II), (1955) and Griffin v. County School Bd. of Prince Edward County, 377 U.S. 218, 234 (1964)("The time for mere 'deliberate speed' has run out"), and to Congress' enactment of Title IV and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. The Court had conclusively settled that faculty segregation was part of the constitutional injury to African-American students, see Rogers v. Paul, 382 U.S. 198 (1965)(per curiam), and that an end of "racially identifiable" school faculties was of primary remedial concern; see United States v. Montgomery County Bd. of Educ., 395 U.S. 225, 232 (1969)(upholding numerical \b \i0 \ul0 [*39]\b0 \i0 \ul0   assignment of black and white teachers); see also Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 486 (1992)(approving court order providing for continued federal court supervision of racial composition of public school faculty). And the Fifth Circuit, with jurisdiction over the entire Deep South, had mandated racially proportional faculty assignments at all schools carrying out desegregation decrees, see Singleton v. Jackson Municipal Separate School Dist., 419 F.2d 1211, 1218 (5th Cir. 1969)(en banc)(per curiam), rev'd and remanded on other grounds sub nom.  Carter v. West Feliciana Parish School Bd., 396 U.S. 290 (1970)(per curiam).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Against this background, -- and at the very same time that it was deciding whether to extend Title VII to public school teachers -- Congress considered and ultimately enacted the Emergency School Aid Act (ESAA), Pub. L. 98-318, codified at 20 U.S.C. \'a7\'a7 3191-3207 (Supp. V 1981)(repealed 1982), which provided local schools with federal funds for "eliminating or preventing minority group isolation and improving the quality of education of all children." A stated purpose of the ESAA was "to meet the special needs \b \i0 \ul0 [*40]\b0 \i0 \ul0   incident to the elimination of minority group segregation . . . among students and faculty in elementary and secondary schools," id. \'a7 703(a), and it was Congress' intention that such funding be available throughout the United States, without regard to whether segregation to be remedied was de jure or de facto, see \'a7 703(a)-(b), New York City Bd. of Educ. v. Harris, 444 U.S. 130 (1979), and included faculty hiring as an authorized activity. \'a7 707(a)(2). The Act defined an "integrated school" as either one with "a faculty and administrative staff with substantial representation from minority groups," \'a7 720(6) or, in school systems with more than 50% minority enrollment, one with:

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 \'a7 720(7). n15 In sum, the same Congress that was extending Title VII's coverage was providing funds for school districts, (1) irrespective of whether they had ever engaged in intentional discrimination, (2) on the express condition that they make race-conscious hiring and assignment decisions, (3) in order to confer an educational benefit on students -- the precise purpose that the majority below confidently held that Congress could not have intended and, in fact, was seeking to outlaw.
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n15 In proposing the measure, President Nixon stated that desegregation not only would benefit the disadvantaged but would help "all children achieve the broad-based human understanding that increasingly is essential in today's world"), H.R. REP. NO. 92-756, 92d Cong., 1st Sess. 3 (1971), a sentiment echoed by the House Committee, see id. at 10. The next Congress amended the Act to make "absolutely clear" that "preventive activities are to be accorded the same importance as activities to eliminate or reduce segregation." Cf. H.R. REP. NO. 95-1137, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 93 (1978)(noting testimony of Assistant Secretary Tatel that ESAA compliance plans had resulted in 116 affirmative action plans leading to the hiring of 300 teachers).

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Third Circuit opinion in this case thus fails as a matter of "straightforward statutory interpretation," judged on the very criteria that it announced for itself. There is no support in the legislative history of the Civil Rights Act for confining employment remedies to remedying the effects of employment discrimination only; there is abundant indication of a Congressional intention not discussed in Weber (a case involving a private sector employer's effort to remedy racial imbalance in its workforce) -- that of increasing minority employment for the non-employment benefit of others (both to assure fair treatment and enhance legitimacy), and a specific record of requiring by law that federal fund recipients make race-conscious faculty employment decisions for the benefit of students. Only in light of this failure of statutory interpretation with respect to the very subject that it had in view -- public school faculty employment -- does the full danger of the lower court's sweeping ruling, that all nonremedial affirmative action for any reason by any employer in any employment decision, come into view.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Even if it were less convincing evidence of Congress' intention, however, the \b \i0 \ul0 [*43]\b0 \i0 \ul0   substantial and complex record of congressional activity with respect to the area of public school faculty employment would be a powerful argument against the unrestrained approach taken by the courts below. Issues involving law enforcement, the delivery of social services, the administration of justice and corrections -- not to mention all private employment -- are no less sensitive or complex than those implicated here, and it was plain error to seek to resolve them all in a single case arising from a single action of a local school board.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 As a matter of statutory construction, the narrow focus of the court below on the status of diversity as a "recognized Title VII purpose," combing only the legislative history of that Act, the ruling disrespects the requirement that courts construe statutes so as to harmonize their purposes with other important policies, both explicit and implicit and in light of the federal structure. See, e.g., Pittsburgh & L.E.R. Co. v. Railway Labor Executives' Ass'n, 491 U.S. 490, 511 (1989)(policies of Railway Labor Act and Interstate Commerce Act); Boys Market v. Retail Clerks Union, 398 U.S. 235 (1970)(relying on national policy \b \i0 \ul0 [*44]\b0 \i0 \ul0   favoring arbitration to craft exemption from absolute bar of Norris-LaGuardia Act). When important policies potentially conflict, accommodation may not come at the wholesale level, but rather at the fact-specific level, in the particular case. See Hostetter v. Bon Voyage Idlewild Liquor Corp., 377 U.S. 324, 332 (1964)(rather than resolving conflict between Commerce Clause and Twenty-First Amendment at general level, "each must be considered in light of the other and in the context of the issues and interests at stake in any concrete case"). These principles do not change because the important government policy is not embodied in a single statute, see Boys Market.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 III. THE LOWER COURTS DID NOT APPLY THE CORRECT LEGAL STANDARD IN DETERMINING WHETHER RESPONDENT'S RIGHTS WERE "UNNECESSARILY TRAMMELED"\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 It is clear from the decisions of the courts below that their conclusion that Respondent's interests were "unnecessarily trammeled" by the challenged employment decision, was inseparable from their erroneous ruling that Petitioner's stated objectives were illegitimate per se under Title VII. Under this Court's jurisprudence, the "unnecessary trammeling" inquiry proceeds \b \i0 \ul0 [*45]\b0 \i0 \ul0   in two steps. First, a court must ascertain whether the employment decision was in fact made to advance a legitimate diversity interest, see Johnson, 480 U.S. at 266 (analogizing reliance on bona fide affirmative action plan to "legitimate nondiscriminatory interest" that employer must advance in disparate treatment case).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The second stage should then entail inquiry into both the strength of an employer's particular diversity interest -- a school district with a history of racially isolated schools, for example, would have a particularly strong claim, as would one seeking to prevent reversion to an all-white department or job category n16 -- and the necessity of taking the particular action, in light of its effect on nonbeneficiaries.
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n16 Of course, a school district that was still under court order to dismantle the vestiges of purposeful discrimination violative of the Fourteenth Amendment could take much stronger measures. See, e.g., Morgan v. Burke, 926 F.2d 86 (1st Cir. 1991)(upholding preferential layoff plan)
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In this case, whether laying off Taxman was the only means available to preserve diversity in the Business Education Department was explicitly \b \i0 \ul0 [*46]\b0 \i0 \ul0   not determined by the courts below, see supra p. 4, text at n.5; cf. Amy Folsom Kett, Race-Based Faculty Hiring and Layoff Remedies in School Desegregation Cases, 104 HARV. L. REV. 1917, 1934 (1991)(noting possibility of work-sharing). Although the burden of a layoff is substantial, and more onerous than hiring or promotion measures, that does not mean a layoff automatically constitutes "unnecessary trammeling," especially here in light of the other factors affecting the reduction-in-force determination: seniority and qualifications (training and certification), and the use of race only where employees remain "tied" after consideration of these additional factors not usually taken into account. n17 Under the Board's affirmative action policy, race became a determinative factor only in that rare instance where no other education-related (i.e., qualifications and experience) characteristic provided a basis for preferring one teacher over another.
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n17 The Board's consistent practice where the diversity interest did not come into play was to toss a coin whenever there was a seniority tie rather than examine individual teachers' qualifications. Thus the operation of the affirmative action policy in this case afforded a white teacher, such as Respondent, tied with another teacher as to seniority, an additional basis (qualifications) for retaining her job without denendine upon the chance of a coin toss.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  \b \i0 \ul0 [*47]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Neither of the courts below engaged in the careful weighing of the interests and factors identified above, and which is an essential prerequisite to determining whether an employer's action, even if taken for a legitimate purpose, "unnecessarily trammeled" the rights of third parties. The judgment below should therefore be vacated on this ground as well.
\par \pard 
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 CONCLUSION\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Federal courts are duty bound to pass only upon questions that emerge from concrete facts and are necessary to the disposition of the case. Because the lower courts here addressed questions that were neither necessary nor appropriate and because they decided those questions incorrectly, their determinations should be vacated and the matter remanded for resolution of the issues raised on a proper factual record.
