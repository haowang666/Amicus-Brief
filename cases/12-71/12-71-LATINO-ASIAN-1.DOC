\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 n1 Letters from the parties consenting generally to the filing of briefs by amicus curiae are on file with the Court. Pursuant to this Court's Rule 37.6, we note that no part of this brief was authored by counsel for any party, and no person or entity other than Amici, their members, and their counsel made any monetary contribution to the preparation or submission of the brief.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Amici are national and state nonprofit organizations dedicated to protecting and advancing the rights of Latino and Asian communities in the United States. n2 Because Latinos and Asians make up a large percentage of the nation's naturalized citizens, Amici are particularly concerned by state statutes, like Arizona's Taxpayer and Citizen Protection Act (Proposition 200), that impede the electoral participation of naturalized citizens by making it especially difficult for them to register to vote. Amici therefore urge the Court to affirm the Ninth Circuit's decision invalidating the voter registration provisions of Proposition 200.

\par \pard 
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\b0 \i0 \ul0  \b \i0 \ul0 [**8]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Our Constitution provides that "a naturalized citizen stands on an equal footing with the native citizen in all respects, save that of eligibility to the Presidency." \b0 \i \ul0 Luria v. United States,\b0 \i0 \ul0  231 U.S. 9, 22 (1913). Arizona's Proposition 200 violates this mandate and is preempted by the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) because it requires naturalized citizens--predominantly Latinos and Asians--to surmount additional and unique hurdles to exercise their fundamental right to vote. By  \b \i0 \ul0 [*2]\b0 \i0 \ul0   imposing additional burdens on naturalized citizens who seek to register to vote, Proposition 200 conflicts with the NVRA's goal of creating a uniform and non-discriminatory voter registration system where applicants can easily register to vote by mail.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Specifically, of the six methods Proposition 200 prescribes for documenting one's citizenship, only three are realistically available to naturalized citizens. Each of these methods is so flawed as to require naturalized citizens to submit multiple applications and to expend significant time and resources:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 1. The first available method requires naturalized citizens to \b0 \i \ul0 appear in-person\b0 \i0 \ul0  at the county recorder's office during \b \i0 \ul0 [**9]\b0 \i0 \ul0   the limited hours it is open to "present" a physical copy of their original naturalization certificate, as federal law prohibits photocopying this document. Naturalized citizens who work from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on weekdays will have to take time off to register to vote and risk a loss of wages. Alternatively, naturalized citizens may attempt to provide the "number of the certificate of naturalization," but Arizona does not have the ability to verify citizenship using this number and, therefore, voter registration applications that provide this number are automatically rejected. Arizona's attempt to cure this systemic flaw by accepting verifiable Alien Registration Numbers instead of the non-verifiable certificate of naturalization numbers has not been generally implemented, contradicts the plain language of Proposition 200 and, in any event, will still result in the rejection of the voter registration applications of newly naturalized citizens because of at least a two-week delay before this information will appear in the  \b \i0 \ul0 [*3]\b0 \i0 \ul0   database upon which county recorders rely. Additionally, many naturalized citizens are unable to provide an Alien Registration Number because they are \b \i0 \ul0 [**10]\b0 \i0 \ul0   required to return their permanent resident cards (which contain this number) prior to naturalizing, and many certificates of naturalization (especially for those citizens who naturalized before 1975) do not include this number.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 2. The second available method, provision of a "driver's license or nonoperating identification license" number issued after October 1, 1996, is not available to the legion of naturalized citizens who obtained a driver's license before they naturalized. Unbeknownst to them, their driver's licenses are associated in the state database with an "F" code (for "Foreign") that renders such licenses useless to verify citizenship. This code typically remains in the database long after the driver is naturalized, but the code is not apparent on the face of the license. Thus, naturalized citizens are generally unaware of the limitation of their licenses until their voter registration applications are denied.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 3. The third available method, mailing photocopies of their United States Passports, will not help most naturalized citizens because they do not have passports, and the application process is expensive and lengthy, with an average four-to_six week processing time.  \b \i0 \ul0 [**11]\b0 \i0 \ul0   This option likewise requires naturalized citizens to appear in-person at a Passport Application Acceptance Facility or a Regional Passport Center with their original naturalization certificates--posing a hardship to those who cannot take off time fromi work during regular business hours or who risk losing wages for doing so.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360  \b \i0 \ul0 [*4]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Far from allowing straightforward mail-in registration, these onerous requirements can often be met only through an in-person appearance at a local governmental office to obtain and provide the requisite documentation. Often, naturalized citizens must submit a voter registration application multiple times before they successfully register to vote. Because the NVRA gives all citizens, including naturalized citizens, the right to use a streamlined, federal, mail-in voter registration form, Proposition 200 is preempted.
\par \pard 
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 ARGUMENT\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \b \i \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I. PROPOSITION 200 IS PART OF A LEGACY OF LAWS AND VOTER RESTRICTIONS THAT TARGET ARIZONA'S IMMIGRANTS AND ADVERSELY IMPACT ITS LARGE POPULATION OF NATURALIZED CITIZENS, MOST OF WHOM ARE LATINO OR ASIAN.\b \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 On November 2, 2004, Arizona voters approved Proposition 200, a ballot initiative predicated on the finding \b \i0 \ul0 [**12]\b0 \i0 \ul0   that "illegal immigrants have been given a safe haven in this state with the aid of identification cards that are issued without verifying immigration status . . . . " (Proposition 200, \'a7 2 (admitted as Trial Ex. 1).) In addition to requiring residents to provide proof of citizenship to register to vote and specified forms of identification at the polls, Proposition 200 contains provisions excluding immigrants from non-federally mandated public benefits. n3 \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  Ariz. Rev. Stat. \'a7\'a7 16-152; 16-166; 16-579; 46-140.01 (2012).
\par \pard 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n3 The only provision of Proposition 200 currently at issue before this Court is Ariz. Rev. Stat. \'a7 16-166, which governs voter registration requirements.
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \fs20 \pard 
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360  \b \i0 \ul0 [*5]\b0 \i0 \ul0   For the entirety of its almost 150-year history, Arizona has enacted legislation specifically targeting naturalized citizens, immigrants, and minorities in order to make the voting process more cumbersome for these groups. n4 When it separated from New Mexico as a new territory in 1863, for instance, Arizona passed restrictive \b \i0 \ul0 [**13]\b0 \i0 \ul0   laws precluding Mexican Americans from electoral eligibility and voting. (Dist. Ct. FOF, at 42 (citing Testimony of Dr. Rosales, Tr. 354; 353-55).) Arizona also maintained literacy and education requirements for voter registration until 1972, a scheme which scholars have concluded was specifically used to intimidate Spanish-speaking and Native American minorities. (\b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 42 (citing testimony of Dr. Rosales, Tr. 354).) And now, through the implementation of Proposition 200, Arizona requires its naturalized citizens to surmount additional and unique hurdles to exercise their right to vote.
\par \pard 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n4 The District Court found this history of discrimination beyond dispute, relying heavily on the expert testimony of Dr. F. Arturo Rosales, a professor of history at Arizona State University, who focuses his studies on Mexican Americans in Arizona. (Dist. Court Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law (Dist. Ct. FOF) at 42-44, \b0 \i \ul0 Gonzalez v. Arizona,\b0 \i0 \ul0  No. 2:06-cv 001268-ROS, (D. Ariz., Docket No. 1041, Aug. 20, 2008).)

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Arizona's longstanding history of imposing burdens on immigrants and minority groups is not limited to the voting rights arena. Almost immediately after the Mexican-American War, Mexican property owners--new U.S. Citizens--were divested of their land. (\b0 \i \ul0 See id)\b0 \i0 \ul0  In 1914, just two years after achieving statehood, Arizona passed a statute requiring employers in businesses with five or more employees to ensure that 80% of their workforce  \b \i0 \ul0 [*6]\b0 \i0 \ul0   consisted of "native-born citizens of the United States"--a statute found unconstitutional by this Court. \b0 \i \ul0 See \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Truax v. Raich,\b0 \i0 \ul0  239 U.S. 33 (1915); (\b0 \i \ul0 see also\b0 \i0 \ul0  Dist. Ct. FOF at 43 (citing Testimony of Dr. Rosales, Tr. 361-62)). Moreover, racial segregation and discrimination were prevalent in Arizona schools and in the workforce. (Dist. Ct. FOF at 43 (citing Testimony of Dr. Rosales, Tr. 357-59, 362).)
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Arizona's disparate treatment of immigrants and minorities continues to this day and has been the subject of numerous constitutional challenges. Indeed, Proposition 200 was enacted in conjunction with a spate of legislation targeting immigrants, including a statute recently found by this Court to be preempted, in large part,  \b \i0 \ul0 [**15]\b0 \i0 \ul0   by federal law. \b0 \i \ul0 Arizona v. United States,\b0 \i0 \ul0  132 S. Ct. 2492, 2510 (2012) (invalidating portions of S.B. 1070, 49th Leg., 2d Reg. Sess. (Ariz. 2010)). n5

\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n5 Arizona is not alone in its attempts to regulate immigration. Numerous other states have likewise passed legislation that conflicts with federal immigration policy. \b0 \i \ul0 See, e.g.\b0 \i0 \ul0  H.B. 56, 2011 Reg. Sess. (Ala. 2011); Senate Enrolled Act No. 590, 117th Sess. (Ind. 2011); A. 69, 119th Sess. (S.C. 2011); H.B. 497, 2011 Gen.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Proposition 200 is part of a long line of legislation targeting Arizona's population \b \i0 \ul0 [**16]\b0 \i0 \ul0   of immigrants and minorities--and, as a consequence, its naturalized citizens, who account for 7.4% of Arizona's citizen voting-age population.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Arizona's \b \i0 \ul0 [**17]\b0 \i0 \ul0   naturalized citizens are predominantly and increasingly Latino and Asian. Latinos and Asians represent 50.8% and 18.7% of Arizona's naturalized citizens of voting age, respectively. Pastor & Sanchez, \b0 \i \ul0 supra\b0 \i0 \ul0 , at 13. These same two groups make up 33.7% of Arizona's general population (Latinos, 30.1%; Asians,; 3.6%).

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Latinos and Asians are becoming naturalized citizens at an accelerating rate. (Expert Report of Dr. Jorge Chapa, Ph.D. ("Chapa Report"), Table 5 (Jan. 4, 2008) (admitted as Trial Ex.; 862).) From 2004 to 2005, naturalization of Latinos increased by 8.3% in contrast to an increase of only 1.4% for  \b \i0 \ul0 [*8]\b0 \i0 \ul0   individuals from non-Hispanic countries. n7 Chapa Report, \b0 \i \ul0 supra,\b0 \i0 \ul0  Table 5.

From 2006 to 2011, the total Asian population of Arizona grew from 2.3% \b \i0 \ul0 [**18]\b0 \i0 \ul0   to 2.7% and, within that population, the number of naturalized foreign-born Asian citizens increased from 17.8% of the State's Asian population to 21.3%.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Proposition 200 requires that Arizona's county recorders "reject any application for registration that is not accompanied by satisfactory evidence of United States citizenship,  \b \i0 \ul0 [**19]\b0 \i0 \ul0   " which can be shown by only six statutorily prescribed methods. Ariz. Rev. Stat. \'a7 16-166(F). Of these methods of proof, only three are  \b \i0 \ul0 [*9]\b0 \i0 \ul0   realistically available for Arizona's naturalized citizens' (\b0 \i \ul0 1)\b0 \i0 \ul0  a presentation to the county recorder of the applicant's U.S. naturalization documents or the number of the certificate of naturalization, \b0 \i \ul0 id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  \'a7 16-166(F)(4); (\b0 \i \ul0 2)\b0 \i0 \ul0  the number of the applicant's Arizona driver's license or state identification card if issued after October 1, 1996, \b0 \i \ul0 id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  \'a7 16-166(F)(1); or (\b0 \i \ul0 3)\b0 \i0 \ul0  a photocopy of the applicant's U.S. Passport, \b0 \i \ul0 id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  \'a7 16-666 (F)(3). n8
\par \pard 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n8 The statute provides additional options that are not available for naturalized citizens. Naturalized citizens will not possess a U.S. birth certificate to satisfy \'a7 16-166(F)(2). (\b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  Arizona Secretary of State, Election Procedures Manual at 43 (Oct. 20070) (admitted as Trial Ex. 4).) Only a small number of naturalized citizens will possess a Bureau of Indian Affairs card number, tribal treaty card number or tribal enrollment number in satisfaction of \'a7 16-166(F)(6).
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Section \'a7 16-166(F)(4) allows county recorders to accept out-of-state licenses if the license states "that the person has provided satisfactory proof of United States citizenship." However, this is not a valid option because no state driver's license contains evidence of U.S. citizenship on its face. (\b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  Dep. of Karen Osborne, Maricopa County Recorder's Office at 24:15-25:11 (July 31, 2006) (admitted into evidence by stipulation, \b0 \i \ul0 Gonzalez v. Arizona,\b0 \i0 \ul0  No. 2:06-cv-001268-ROS (D. Ariz., Docket No. 1009, July 22, 2008)); \b0 \i \ul0 see also\b0 \i0 \ul0  Letter from Maricopa County Elections Department to Registrant (Sept. 23. 2005) (admitted as Trial Ex. 210).)
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Lastly, although \'a7 16-166(F)(5) provides that applicants may present any "[o]ther documents or methods of proof that are established pursuant to the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986," this method is likewise not a valid option because that federal statute did not establish any methods of proof of citizenship.     Pub. L. No. 99-603,     100 Stat 3359 (Nov. 6, 1986) (codified in scattered sections of Title 8).

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 As more fully explained below, and as recognized by the District Court, naturalized citizens face numerous obstacles in satisfying the requirements  \b \i0 \ul0 [*10]\b0 \i0 \ul0   of \'a7\'a7 16-166(F)(1), (3) and (4). (\b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  Dist. Ct. FOF at 12, 30 & 36-37 (finding that naturalized citizens may have to apply twice to register to vote, pay a fee to complete the second registration, or register in person at the county recorder's office).) As just one example, an Arizona driver's license will not suffice as proof of citizenship for Arizona residents who obtained their driver's licenses before they became naturalized citizens, while they were legal permanent residents, because a state database code of "F" for "Foreign" is associated with their licenses. In addition, foreign-born individuals who obtain derivative citizenship through, for example, the naturalization of their parents, are not required to apply for a certificate of citizenship. Therefore, their options are even more limited, and they may find themselves without adequate proof of their citizenship under the statute when registering to vote--requiring them to undertake a lengthy and costly process for obtaining the requisite documents to satisfy Proposition \b \i0 \ul0 [**21]\b0 \i0 \ul0   200.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The lead Plaintiffs in this case encountered many of the difficulties that confront naturalized citizens in Arizona when they try to register to vote. For instance, Mr. Jesus Gonzalez is an Arizona resident and naturalized citizen who was repeatedly frustrated in his attempts to register to vote as a result of Proposition 200. Mr. Gonzalez was born in Mexico and has lived in the United States for more than four decades. Immediately after taking an oath of citizenship at a naturalization ceremony, Mr. Gonzalez filled out a voter registration application and provided his certificate of naturalization number as proof of citizenship--as instructed by \'a7 16-166 (F)(4) and the voter registration application Mr.  \b \i0 \ul0 [*11]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Gonzalez completed. (Dist. Ct. FOF at 17 (citing testimony of Jesus M. Gonzalez, Tr. at 222-223; Deficiency Letter from Krysty Marin, Yuma County Recorder's Office to Jesus Gonzalez (undated) (admitted as Trial Ex. 712)).) But Mr. Gonzalez's application was denied because the State does not have the ability to verify citizenship using that number. (\b0 \i \ul0 Id)\b0 \i0 \ul0  Mr. Gonzalez attempted to register a second time by submitting his Arizona driver's license as proof of citizenship \b \i0 \ul0 [**22]\b0 \i0 \ul0   pursuant to \'a7 16-166 (F)(1), but this application was also denied as unsatisfactory under Proposition 200. (Dist. Ct. FOF at 18 (citing Testimony of Mr. Gonzalez, Tr. 220-225).)
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Unfortunately, Mr. Gonzalez's story is not uncommon. Between January 2005 and September 2007, 11,000 Arizona citizens had to attempt registration under Proposition 200 at least two times before successfully registering to vote. (Dist. Ct. FOF at 14 (citing Testimony of Dr. Louis Lanier, Tr. 329).) All told, more than 31,000 applicants were rejected during this period, (\b0 \i \ul0 id.),\b0 \i0 \ul0  and, while 11,000 of them succeeded after repeat attempts, it seems that many, like Mr. Gonzalez, were simply' deterred from registering to vote after receiving one or more rejections. Ultimately, 20,000 Arizona residents (approximately 20% of whom are Latinos) n9 were  \b \i0 \ul0 [*12]\b0 \i0 \ul0   unable to register to vote because of Proposition 200's onerous requirements. The unique obstacles presented by the law effectively relegated this population to second-class citizenship.

\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n9 Plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Lanier, determined that the effect of voter registration rejections due to Proposition 200 fell disproportionately on Latinos. The representation of Latinos among the rejected applicants under Prop 200 was 2.8% higher than their representation in the total number of registration applicants. (Dist. Ct. FOF at 13 (citing testimony of Dr. Lanier, Ex. 883, Table 2).) Dr. Lanier also concluded that Latinos (like Mr. Gonzalez) were less likely to reregister successfully after having their registration forms rejected pursuant to Prop 200. (Testimony of Dr. Lanier, Tr. at 262:10-263:1.)

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Ariz. Rev. Stat. \'a7 16-166(F)(4). Naturalized citizens often face significant hurdles in "presenting" their naturalization documents to the county recorder. And the alternative of presenting the "number of the certificate of naturalization" is futile because the State cannot use that number to verify citizenship - prompting an automatic rejection of the eligible voter's application and the need for (undeterred) naturalized citizens to submit a subsequent voter registration application with additional information,  \b \i0 \ul0 [**24]\b0 \i0 \ul0   risking their timely registration.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360  \b \i0 \ul0 [*13]\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b \i0 \ul0 1. Proposition 200 Mandates In-Person "Presentation" of Naturalization Documents for Naturalized Citizens.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Unlike native-born citizens who are permitted under Proposition 200 to submit a "photocopy" of their birth certificates to the county recorder, Proposition 200 requires naturalized citizens to "present" a physical copy of their certificates of naturalization to the county recorder. Ariz. Rev. Stat. \'a7 16-166(F)(2), (4).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Office of the Arizona Secretary of State has consistently interpreted \'a7 16-166F(4) to mean that an original naturalization certificate must be presented in person, as opposed to being mailed. (Testimony of Dr. Joseph Kanefield, Tr. at 699:17-25; 765:20-766:8.) The in-person requirement is consistent with not only the plain language of the statute and the Secretary of State's interpretation, but also federal law--which criminalizes the copying of a naturalization certificate "without lawful authority." 18 U.S.C. \'a7 1426(h) (2006). In fact, the certificate of naturalization itself prominently states in red ink and capital letters: "IT IS PUNISHABLE BY U.S. LAW TO COPY, PRINT OR PHOTOGRAPH \b \i0 \ul0 [**25]\b0 \i0 \ul0   THIS CERTIFICATE, WITHOUT LAWFUL AUTHORITY." (Photocopy of Naturalization Certificate for Jesus Maria Gonzalez (admitted as Trial Ex. 711).) Thus, to satisfy \'a7 16T166F(4) with a certificate of naturalization, an applicant must appear before the county recorder in person to present proof of citizenship.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This in-person requirement applies only to naturalized citizens and creates significant hardships. For example, it may be impossible for an applicant to go to the county recorder's office during  \b \i0 \ul0 [*14]\b0 \i0 \ul0   the limited hours the office is open. n10 Applicants may have difficulty appearing in the office due to their work schedules and may be unable or unwilling to take time off from work to appear in-person to register (and will lose income if they are hourly wage-earners). Applicants may also experience difficulty travelling to the counties' offices, if, for example, they live in a rural area that is a great distance from the recorder's office and do not have access to a car or an easy means of public transportation. n11

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Proposition 200 also provides that naturalized citizens may register to vote by supplying the "number of the certificate of naturalization" on their voter registration forms, subject to the county recorder's ability to verify the certificate number with the federal government. Ariz. Rev. Stat. \'a7 16-166 (F)(4).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Following passage of Proposition 200, the Secretary of State updated the State's voter registration form to add a new box 20 on the form that requested the "number of the certificate of naturalization." (Arizona Secretary of State Election Procedures Manual at 47 (Oct. 2007) (admitted as Trial Ex. 4).) However, it is undisputed that the State is, in fact, unable to verify that number. The database the State relies upon to conduct its verification is the USCIS Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or "SAVE" Database, and the SAVE system allows queries only by Alien Registration Numbers, not by a certificate of naturalization number. (\b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  Dist. Ct. FOF at 4 (citing testimony of Dr. Kanefield, Tr. at 654);  \b \i0 \ul0 [**31]\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b0 \i \ul0 see also\b0 \i0 \ul0  Ratliff Dep. at 19:16-19, 32:14-19, 43:19-44:4 (Apr. 22, 2008).)
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360  \b \i0 \ul0 [*18]\b0 \i0 \ul0   The certificate of naturalization number and the Alien Registration Number are not interchangeable. The Alien Registration Number is used by non-citizens to provide information to USCIS while they are under the supervision and control of the federal government. After naturalization, USCIS has no further business with an immigrant, and an individual who naturalizes must turn in his or her Alien Registration Card to USCIS. (Ratliff Dep. at 83:4-6, 88:6-12 (Apr. 22, 2008); Dep. of Michael Quinn, Chief of Record Services at 40:9-13, 45:4-12 (Apr. 22, 2008).)
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Accordingly, asking applicants to provide the naturalization certificate number created a system under which county recorders automatically rejected the application of every naturalized citizen who attempted to register to vote by complying with this provision of Proposition 200. After automatically rejecting the application, the county recorder then required applicants like Mr. Gonzalez, who had simply followed the voter registration form in the first place, to apply again and provide different citizenship information. This system not only deterred \b \i0 \ul0 [**32]\b0 \i0 \ul0   many eligible voters, but also risked the timeliness of their voter registration for purposes of a particular election because they would not be deemed registered until the subsequent application (if filed) was approved.
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 3. The State's Post Hoc Attempt To Cure This Faulty System by Requiring Verifiable Alien Registration Numbers Does Not Lift the Unreasonable Burdens on Naturalized Citizens.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Two years after implementing Proposition 200 and while defending against this lawsuit, Arizona sought and received permission from the U.S. Department of  \b \i0 \ul0 [*19]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Justice to request that naturalized citizens provide a number \b0 \i \ul0 other\b0 \i0 \ul0  than that mandated by Proposition 200 in order to register to vote. However, the current Secretary of State's decision to change the Arizona voter registration form to request the "Alien Registration Number"--which, incidentally, naturalized citizens no longer have any other use for--has not cured the difficulties created by this provision of Proposition 200. (Dist. Ct. FOF at 4; F. Ann Rodriguez Dep. at 60:18:22 (August 2, 2006).)
\par \b0 \i \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 First,\b0 \i0 \ul0  some county recorders continue to request that applicants provide the number of their certificates of naturalization \b \i0 \ul0 [**33]\b0 \i0 \ul0   when registering to vote, as is required by the statute. The registration form posted on certain counties' websites asks for a certificate of naturalization number, as do the circulated paper registration forms. (\b0 \i \ul0 See, e.g.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  Voter Registration Form from Santa Cruz County Website (admitted as Trial Ex. 216); Voter Registration Form from Pinal County Website (admitted as Trial Ex. 219); Voter Registration Form from Maricopa County Website (admitted as Trial Ex. 221); Greenlee County Recorder's Office Voter Registration website and Voter Registration Form downloaded from it (admitted as Trial Ex. 223); Jasper Altaha Dep. 39:20-40:12 (Jan. 23, 208) (noting that as of January 2008 all paper voter registration forms in Maricopa County requested the "certificate of naturalization" number).) Applicants who follow this instruction will be rejected automatically and put through the double-registration process reserved only for naturalized citizens. The inconsistent enforcement of Proposition 200--with some county recorders insisting on the number specified in the statute, while other counties request a different number later  \b \i0 \ul0 [*20]\b0 \i0 \ul0   specified by the Secretary of State--alone infringes \b \i0 \ul0 [**34]\b0 \i0 \ul0   upon the fundamental right to vote by placing "unfettered discretion" regarding registration requirements in the hands of local county officials. \b0 \i \ul0 See \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 FW/PBS, Inc.\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 493 U.S. at 225; \b0 \i \ul0 Papachristou,\b0 \i0 \ul0  405 U.S. at 168; \b0 \i \ul0 Staub\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 355 U.S. at 322.
\par \b0 \i \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Second,\b0 \i0 \ul0  the plain language of Proposition 200 requires that an applicant provide "the number of the certificate of naturalization," not the Alien Registration Number or any other number that can be found on the naturalization certificate, such as the applicant's date of birth or date of naturalization. The statute does not authorize the Secretary of State or county recorders to request an applicant's Alien Registration Number. As such, no future Secretary of State is bound by the current decision to request the Alien Registration Number.
\par \b0 \i \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Third,\b0 \i0 \ul0  naturalized citizens encounter difficulties registering to vote even if the State relies upon their purportedly verifiable Alien Registration Numbers. Because of delays in the entry of citizenship information into the USCIS database following naturalization ceremonies, county recorders are unable to confirm citizenship of newly naturalized citizens for \b \i0 \ul0 [**35]\b0 \i0 \ul0   two weeks or longer, and the county recorders will reject any application that they cannot verify in SAVE. (Email from Craig Stender to Roberta Abney et al. (Sept. 28, 2005) (admitted as Trial Ex. 304); VRAZ-II County Advisory Committee, Issue 0059-Citizenship-Verification of Naturalization through SAVE (undated) (admitted as Trial Ex. 307); Arizona Secretary of State Election Procedures Manual at 47 (Oct. 2007) (admitted as Trial Ex. 4).)
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Recognizing that the federal database may not reflect the U.S. citizenship status of recently  \b \i0 \ul0 [*21]\b0 \i0 \ul0   naturalized citizens, the State's Elections Procedures Manual instructs county recorders to advise naturalized citizens that they may have to provide \b0 \i \ul0 additional\b0 \i0 \ul0  documentary proof of citizenship when they register to vote if the federal database system cannot confirm their citizenship before the registration deadline for an upcoming election. (Arizona Secretary of State Election Procedures Manual at 47 (Oct. 2007) (admitted as Trial Ex. 4); Rodriguez Dep. at, 36:6-37:13 (Jan. 22, 2008); Marin Dep. at 51:7-9 (Jan. 18, 2008); Osborne Dep. at 48:8-22 (Jan. 14, 2008).) Moreover, some naturalization certificates do not have an Alien Registration \b \i0 \ul0 [**36]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Number printed on them, and naturalized citizens may have no other means to obtain this number as they are required to turn in their permanent resident cards before taking the oath of U.S. citizenship pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \'a7 338.3. (\b0 \i \ul0 See, e.g.\b0 \i0 \ul0 , Certificate of Naturalization for Herta Antoinette Anita Weber (admitted as Trial Ex. 961); Quinn Dep. at 56:11-15 (April 22, 2008).) Citizens who naturalized before 1975 face particular difficulties because Alien Registration Numbers were neither printed on their certificates of naturalization nor used to track them in the federal immigration service's database; rather, "certificate numbers" were used to track these individuals and these numbers would likely not be found in the Central Index System database used today. (Dist. Ct. FOF at 4 (citing Quinn Dep. at 53:13-54:20 (Apr. 22, 2008)); \b0 \i \ul0 see also\b0 \i0 \ul0  Quinn Dep. at 56:16-20, 61:21-63:9, 64:9-16 (April 22, 2008).)
\par \b0 \i \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Fourth,\b0 \i0 \ul0  the record demonstrates that naturalized citizens may be confused by a county recorder's request for an Alien Registration Number and consequently deterred from re-applying to register to  \b \i0 \ul0 [*22]\b0 \i0 \ul0   vote. For example, the reaction of Mr. Gonzalez's \b \i0 \ul0 [**37]\b0 \i0 \ul0   wife, a witness in the case who is also a naturalized citizen, to the county recorder's request for an Alien Registration Number was "[t]hat it couldn't be, because I'm already an American citizen, and they were asking me for a document that was irrelevant." (Testimony of Maria Magdelena Gonzalez, Tr. at 213:17-23.) Naturalized citizens are required to surrender their Alien Registration Cards when they naturalize, and they would have no reason to retain the Alien Registration Number for subsequent use.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 A naturalized citizen may also present "the number of [his or her] driver's license or nonoperating identification license issued after October 1, 1996 by the department of transportation" to satisfy Proposition 200.

This "F" code, however, is not apparent on the face of the driver's license and does not change even when an individual's citizenship status changes. Rather, all information related to whether a customer has a Type F license is contained in his or her database record and that record is used for all future transactions with the MVD.

Beyond the obvious burdens associated with having to visit the MVD in person to update a driver's license record to reflect a change in citizenship status, this fix is also unlikely given that individuals holding a Type F license receive no indication that their licenses are inadequate for the purpose of voter registration until their applications to register are rejected.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Asian & Pacific Islander American Vote (APIAVote)\b0 \i0 \ul0  is a national nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that encourages and promotes civic participation of Asian Pacific Islander Americans in the electoral and public policy processes at the national, state and local levels. APIAVote envisions a society in which all Asian Pacific Islander Americans fully participate in and have access to the democratic process. As such, APIAVote has a longstanding interest in voting rights and protecting the rights of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders to access the polls. This interest has resulted in APIA Vote's Congressional testimony against restrictive proof of citizenship and identification requirements and participation in a number of amicus briefs before the courts on the issue.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The \b \i0 \ul0 Asian American Bar Association of the Greater Bay Area (AABA)\b0 \i0 \ul0  represents the interests of Asian Pacific American attorneys in the Greater San Francisco Bay Area. It is one of the largest Asian Pacific American bar associations in the nation and one of the largest minority bar associations in the State of California. From its inception in 1976, AABA has been actively involved \b \i0 \ul0 [**56]\b0 \i0 \ul0   in civil rights issues and has advocated on issues regarding minority communities, diversity, and equal protection. Among other things, AABA filed an amicus brief in the \b0 \i \ul0 Bakke\b0 \i0 \ul0  affirmative action case in the United States Supreme Court in 1977 and in \b0 \i \ul0 In re Marriage Cases\b0 \i0 \ul0  in the California Supreme Court in 2007.
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Asian American Institute (AAI)\b0 \i0 \ul0  is a pan-Asian, non-partisan, not-for-profit organization located in  \b \i0 \ul0 [*2a]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Chicago, Illinois, whose mission is to empower and advocate for the Asian American community through advocacy, coalition-building, education, and research. AAI is a member of the Asian American Center for Advancing Justice, whose other members include Asian American Justice Center, Asian Law Caucus, and Asian Pacific American Legal Center. AAI's programs include community organizing, leadership development, and legal advocacy. AAI is deeply concerned about the discrimination and other challenges that immigrants face, including laws or policies that disproportionately impact and hinder eligible citizens' ability to exercise their fundamental right to vote. Accordingly, AAI has a strong interest in this case.
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Asian American Justice Center (AAJC)\b0 \i0 \ul0  is \b \i0 \ul0 [**57]\b0 \i0 \ul0   a national nonprofit, nonpartisan organization based in Washington, D.C. AAJC is a member of the Asian American Center for Advancing Justice, whose other members are Asian American Institute, Asian Law Caucus, and Asian Pacific American Legal Center. Founded in 1991, AAJC works to advance the human and civil rights of Asian Americans through advocacy, public policy, public education, and litigation. In accomplishing its mission, AAJC strives to promote civic engagement, forge strong and safe communities, and create an inclusive society in communities on a local, regional, and national level. A nationally recognized voice on behalf of Asian Americans, AAJC focuses its expertise on voting rights, anti-Asian violence prevention/race relations, census issues, immigrant rights, language access, and affirmative action. AAJC has maintained a strong interest in the voting rights of Asian Americans and strives to protect Asian Americans'  \b \i0 \ul0 [*3a]\b0 \i0 \ul0   access to the polls. AAJC has supported efforts to increase access to voter registration, including working on the successful passage of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993. Such long-standing interest has resulted in AAJC's participation \b \i0 \ul0 [**58]\b0 \i0 \ul0   in a number of amicus briefs before the courts regarding voting rights and on this particular issue.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The \b \i0 \ul0 Asian Law Alliance (ALA),\b0 \i0 \ul0  founded in 1977, is a nonprofit public interest legal organization with the mission of providing equal access to the justice system to the Asian and Pacific Islander communities in Santa Clara County, California. Through our Voting Rights and Education project, ALA has monitored the implementation of Section 203 of the Voting Rights Act since 1998.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Established in 1972, the \b \i0 \ul0 Asian Law Caucus\b0 \i0 \ul0  (ALC) is the country's oldest civil rights and public interest legal organization serving the Asian Pacific American community. ALC is dedicated to the pursuit of equality and justice for all sectors of society. ALC represents primarily low-income, monolingual, or limited English proficient Asian Pacific Americans in the areas of employment/labor, immigration, housing/community development, and civil rights. Through our Voting Rights project, ALC works to ensure the full participation of all eligible voters in the electoral process.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Founded in 1983, the \b \i0 \ul0 Asian Pacific American Legal Center of Southern California (APALC),\b0 \i0 \ul0  a member of the Asian American \b \i0 \ul0 [**59]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Center for Advancing Justice, is the nation's largest nonprofit public interest law firm devoted to the Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander community. APALC provides direct legal services to indigent members of our community and uses impact litigation, policy advocacy,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*4a]\b0 \i0 \ul0   community education and leadership development to obtain, safeguard and improve the civil rights of Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders. APALC's civil rights litigation has covered a broad range of issues such as race and national origin discrimination, access to education, immigration and naturalization, language rights, garment worker rights and other low-wage worker exploitation. APALC has a long history of working to protect the voting rights of historically disenfranchised communities and thus has a strong interest in the outcome of this case.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The \b \i0 \ul0 Asian Pacific American Network of Oregon (APANO)\b0 \i0 \ul0  is a statewide, grassroots organization, uniting Asians and Pacific Islanders to achieve social justice. We envision a just and equitable world where Asians and Pacific Islanders are fully engaged in the social, economic and political issues that affect us. APANO has \b \i0 \ul0 [**60]\b0 \i0 \ul0   worked for over 15 years engaging Asian and Pacific Islander citizens in the electoral process, providing language access and increasing opportunities for civic participation. Arizona's Proposition 200 is inconsistent with federal requirements, adding additional burdens for citizens in the democratic process and further impacting Asian and Pacific Islander communities who currently experience significant disparities in voter participation.
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Asian Services in Action, Inc. (ASIA)\b0 \i0 \ul0  is a nonprofit health and human services agency in Ohio dedicated to empowering and advocating for Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders (AAPIs) and to providing AAPIs access to quality, culturally, and linguistically appropriate information and services. Incorporated in 1995, ASIA serves over 10,000 individuals  \b \i0 \ul0 [*5a]\b0 \i0 \ul0   annually, the majority of whom are immigrants and refugees from Asia, through legal assistance, social services, vocational training, and issue advocacy. ASIA believes that Proposition 200 places undue burdens on, and chills civic engagement among, voter registrants and voters who are naturalized citizens. In the course of conducting a nonpartisan, statewide Voter Registration and Education \b \i0 \ul0 [**61]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Project in 2012, ASIA and its partners witnessed firsthand how limited English proficiency and unfamiliarity with American civic institutions created high barriers for AAPI naturalized citizens who wished to vote, both during voter registration and at the polls. ASIA staff and volunteers prevented several such citizens from being wrongfully turned away from the polls due to simple misunderstandings on Election Day. Given the negligible national rate of proven voter fraud, ASIA believes that proof of citizenship laws unnecessarily hamper naturalized citizens from participating in our democracy.
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Association of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations (AAPCHO)\b0 \i0 \ul0  is a national association of community health organizations serving medically underserved Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and other Pacific Islanders. AAPCHO is dedicated to promoting advocacy, collaboration, leadership, access, and civic participation to improve the health status of these groups. As a unified voice of its membership, AAPCHO shares its collective knowledge and experiences with policy makers at the national, state, and local levels. In addition, AAPCHO and its member centers seek to improve the integration \b \i0 \ul0 [**62]\b0 \i0 \ul0   and engagement of community health centers and their patients in the electoral process.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360  \b \i0 \ul0 [*6a]\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b \i0 \ul0 Center for Asian Pacific American Women\b0 \i0 \ul0  is a national organization dedicated to building leadership capacity in our communities. The intention of the National Voter Registration Act was to encourage greater access to voter registration for our citizens. The NVRA increased the opportunity for our citizens to engage in our communities. Proposition 200 places yet another obstacle in the expansion of civic participation and leadership.
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Center for Pan Asian Community Services, Inc. (CPACS)\b0 \i0 \ul0  is a private nonprofit located in Atlanta, Georgia. Our mission is to promote self-sufficiency and equity for immigrants, refugees, and the underprivileged through comprehensive health and social services, capacity building, and advocacy. CPACS has sponsored numerous events and provided community services such as voter registration drives, polling site assistance, exit polling, voter education, etc. during the most recent election cycle. CPACS supports the protection and advancement of the voting rights of Asian and Pacific Islander Americans.
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Chinese for Affirmative Action (CAA)\b0 \i0 \ul0  was \b \i0 \ul0 [**63]\b0 \i0 \ul0   founded in 1969 to protect the civil and political rights of Chinese Americans and to advance multiracial democracy in the United States. Today, CAA is a progressive voice in and on behalf of the broader Asian and Pacific American community. CAA advocates for systemic change that protects immigrant rights, promotes language diversity, and remedies racial injustice.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Founded in 1972, the \b \i0 \ul0 Chinese Progressive Association (CPA)\b0 \i0 \ul0  educates, organizes and empowers the lowincome and working class immigrant Chinese community in San Francisco to build  \b \i0 \ul0 [*7a]\b0 \i0 \ul0   collective power with other oppressed communities to demand better living and working conditions and justice for all people. As part of the CPA's Political Empowerment Campaign, CPA has trained and developed dozens of new grassroots leaders and reached thousands of Chinese immigrant voters.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Founded in 1973, \b \i0 \ul0 Filipino Advocates for Justice (FAJ)\b0 \i0 \ul0  is an advocate for immigrant and civil rights for the Filipino community and serves the more vulnerable in our community by helping recent arrivals, youth and low wage workers navigate the challenges and hurdles of life in the US. FAJ seeks to build a strong and empowered Filipino community \b \i0 \ul0 [**64]\b0 \i0 \ul0   by organizing constituents, developing leaders, providing services, and advocating for policies that promote social and economic justice and equity for all.
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Hispanic Federation\b0 \i0 \ul0  provides grants to a broad network of Latino nonprofit agencies serving the most vulnerable members of the Hispanic community and advocates nationally with respect to the vital issues of education, health, immigration, economic empowerment, civic engagement, and the environment.
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Hispanic National Bar Association (HNBA)\b0 \i0 \ul0  is a nonprofit, nonpartisan, national professional association that represents the interests of over 100,000 attorneys, judges, law professors, legal assistants, and law students of Hispanic descent in the United States and its territories. The HNBA has thirty-eight affiliated bars in various states across the country. The continuing mission of the HNBA is to improve the study, practice, and administration of justice for all Americans by ensuring the meaningful participation of Hispanics in the legal profession.  \b \i0 \ul0 [*8a]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Since its inception 40 years ago, the HNBA has served as the national voice for Hispanics in the legal profession and has promoted justice, equity, and opportunity \b \i0 \ul0 [**65]\b0 \i0 \ul0   for Hispanics.
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Japanese American Citizens League (JACL)\b0 \i0 \ul0  was founded in 1929. It is the oldest and largest Asian American civil rights organization in the United States. JACL has over 10,000 members and 110 chapters throughout the Nation, including Arizona. The JACL was a leading organization in removing state alien land laws and in securing redress for Japanese Americans imprisoned during World War II. The JACL also has a long history of advocacy in issues relating to immigration, naturalization, and voting rights.
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Labor Council for Latin American Advancement (LCLAA)\b0 \i0 \ul0  is a national organization representing the interests of approximately 2.2 million Latino trade unionists in the United States and Puerto Rico. Founded in 1973, LCLAA builds coalitions between the Latino community and Unions in order to advance the civil, economic and human rights of all Latinos.
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 LatinoJustice PRLDEF\b0 \i0 \ul0  (formerly known as the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund) was founded in New York City in 1972. Its continuing mission is to protect the civil rights of all Latinos and to promote justice for the pan-Latino community especially across the Eastern United States. It has worked \b \i0 \ul0 [**66]\b0 \i0 \ul0   to secure the voting rights and political participation of Latino voters since 1972 when it initiated a series of suits to create bilingual voting systems throughout the United States.
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 National Asian Pacific American Bar Association (NAPABA)\b0 \i0 \ul0  is the national association of Asian  \b \i0 \ul0 [*9a]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Pacific American attorneys, judges, law professors, and law students. NAPABA represents the interests of over 40,000 attorneys and more than 60 local Asian Pacific American bar associations, who work variously in solo practices, large firms, corporations, legal services organizations, nonprofit organizations, law schools, and government agencies. Since its inception in 1988, NAPABA has served as the national voice for Asian Pacific Americans in the legal profession and has promoted justice, equity, and opportunity for Asian Pacific Americans. NAPABA engages in civil rights advocacy on various fronts and has a particular interest in ensuring that all naturalized citizens are afforded the opportunity to vote and therefore opposes restrictive voter registration laws.
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 National Asian Pacific American Women's Forum (NAPAWF)\b0 \i0 \ul0  is the only national, multi-issue Asian and Pacific Islander (API)  \b \i0 \ul0 [**67]\b0 \i0 \ul0   women's organization in the country, with offices in Washington D.C., New York, and Oakland, and eleven chapters throughout the United States. NAPAWF's mission is to build a movement to advance social justice and human rights for API women and girls. Since its founding, NAPAWF has supported and advocated for public policies that advance civil rights, economic opportunity, educational access, health and reproductive justice, immigrant and refugee rights, and efforts to end violence against women and girls. Barriers to voting pose a significant obstacle to the full range of civil rights for API women. NAPAWF strongly supports this effort to ensure that all citizens have a meaningful right to vote.
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO) Educational Fund\b0 \i0 \ul0  is  \b \i0 \ul0 [*10a]\b0 \i0 \ul0   the leading nonprofit organization that facilitates full Latino participation in the American political process, from citizenship to public service. Our constituents include the more than 6,000 Latino elected and appointed officials nationwide who serve on bodies including local and state school boards, municipal councils, state legislatures, and the U.S. Congress. For several decades,  \b \i0 \ul0 [**68]\b0 \i0 \ul0   the NALEO Educational Fund has worked to mobilize eligible Latinos to register and vote, and to build integrated national and local Latino voter education and participation programs, because our nation's growing Latino electorate must be fully engaged in order to ensure the sustained strength of our democracy. In particular, we advocate voter registration procedures that encourage the broadest possible involvement in elections of new and historically under-represented Americans.
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 National Institute for Latino Policy\b0 \i0 \ul0  is a nonpartisan policy center established in 1982 that focuses on Latino policy issues. Among our concerns are the rights of immigrants in the United States and the promotion of full civic participation by the Latino community. The policies of the State of Arizona in placing unique obstacles on immigrants in their ability to vote represents a major act of discrimination that results in the disenfranchisement of a disproportionate number of persons from this class. We oppose such policies.
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 National Organization for Mexican American Rights, Inc. (NOMAR, Inc.),\b0 \i0 \ul0  a national nonprofit organization with the mission to protect the civil rights of Hispanic Americans \b \i0 \ul0 [**69]\b0 \i0 \ul0   and to promote equal opportunity for Hispanic Americans in employment and education, supports the respondents in the above  \b \i0 \ul0 [*11a]\b0 \i0 \ul0   mentioned case before the Supreme Court of the United States. A critical mission of NOMAR, Inc. is to protect the civil rights of Hispanic Americans, which include the fundamental right of all United States citizens to vote. We believe that this right extends to all citizens whether born in the United States, or naturalized after migrating to the United States. We believe that the state of Arizona, through Proposition 200, passed in 2004, has instituted a voter registration process that discriminates against Latino and Asian naturalized citizens by imposing unreasonable and essentially unachievable requirements to prove citizenship that effectively deny them their right to vote. We believe that this law violates the intent of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 ("NVRA") and that the voter registration requirements of Proposition 200 directly conflict with the NVRA's command for voter registration that is uniform, nondiscriminatory, and in compliance with the Voting Rights Act of 1965. We believe that these requirements are intended to suppress \b \i0 \ul0 [**70]\b0 \i0 \ul0   the voting rights of Latinos and Asians, and is based on a xenophobic bias against Latinos and Asians. Therefore, NOMAR, Inc. fully supports the respondents' position that this law is unconstitutional.
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 OneAmerica\b0 \i0 \ul0  was formed directly after September 11, 2001, in response to the hate crimes and discrimination against immigrant communities. Its mission is to advance the fundamental principles of democracy, justice, and human rights at the local, state and national levels. OneAmerica works with community partners to protect and strengthen fundamental American rights for all people, especially immigrants. OneAmerica has become a  \b \i0 \ul0 [*12a]\b0 \i0 \ul0   leading voice in shaping policies that directly impact Washington State's immigrant communities, including policies and practices that assist immigrants on their path to citizenship and ensure their full civic engagement.
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 South Asian Americans Leading Together (SAALT)\b0 \i0 \ul0  is a national nonprofit organization whose mission is to elevate the voices and perspectives of South Asian individuals and organizations to build a more just and inclusive society in the United States. As an organization that is committed to the importance of civic engagement \b \i0 \ul0 [**71]\b0 \i0 \ul0   and addressing societal disparities that have historically and currently affected the South Asian community and other immigrant communities, SAALT joins this brief as Proposition 200 disparately impacts naturalized citizens in their fundamental right to register to vote.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The \b \i0 \ul0 South Asian Bar Association of Northern California (SABA-NC)\b0 \i0 \ul0  was founded in 1993 to ensure that Bay Area South Asian lawyers were provided an avenue to develop professionally, network among peers and volunteer within the South Asian community. SABA-NC supports and hosts fundraisers for South Asian community support, and social service organizations, and facilitates pro bono legal services to those in need. SABA-NC has supported and participated in voter registration drives and voter protection poll monitoring projects.
