\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Congress enacted the NVRA to establish, among other things, "procedures that [would] increase the number of eligible citizens who register to vote in elections for Federal office" and "to protect the integrity of the electoral process." \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  42 U.S.C. \'a7 1973gg(b). The NVRA states that "the right of citizens of the United States to vote is a fundamental right," and "discriminatory and unfair registration laws and procedures can have a direct and damaging effect on voter participation in elections for Federal office and disproportionately harm voter participation by various groups including racial minorities." \b0 \i \ul0 See id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  \'a7 1973gg(a).

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Proposition 200 requires that the county recorder reject any voter registration application if the applicant has not provided "satisfactory evidence of citizenship." \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  Ariz. Rev. Stat. \'a7 16-166(F) ('The county recorder shall reject any application for registration that is not accompanied by satisfactory evidence of United States citizenship."). Satisfactory evidence of citizenship may be established by providing one of the following:

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In Arizona, Asian Americans make up approximately 3% of the population, but approximately 21.3% of foreign-born naturalized citizens. Of the estimated 194,475 Asian Americans living in Arizona, approximately 35.9% are foreign-born naturalized citizens. White Americans make up 79.3% of the population and only 5.05%. of White Americans are foreign-born naturalized citizens. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  U.S. Census Bureau, American FactFinder; 2011 American Community Survey, 1-Year Estimates S0501, Selected Characteristics of the Native and Foreign-Born Populations, Arizona, 2011 (the "U.S. Census Native and Foreign-Born Populations Data"). Given these statistics, Asian Americans are at a disproportionate risk of disenfranchisement through the implementation of Proposition 200. This Court's  \b \i0 \ul0 [*7]\b0 \i0 \ul0   determination will have major implications on new Asian American citizens wishing to exercise their right to participate in the electoral process.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Court's determination could potentially impact new Asian American citizens far beyond Arizona's borders. Four states--Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee and Kansas--have passed similar \b \i0 \ul0 [**9]\b0 \i0 \ul0   proof-of-citizenship laws. n5 Notably, Georgia's proof-of-citizenship law, SB 86, closely mirrors Proposition 200 and has resulted in serious barriers to Asian Americans seeking to register to vote in Georgia. For example, as of October 31, 2012--only days before Election Day 2012--282 applicants had been flagged as requiring additional certification, mostly involving additional citizenship certification of newly naturalized citizens. n6 Calls to county election boards inquiring about the flagged status only led to conflicting instructions and information. n7 Volunteers from certain community-based organizations were told by the contacted counties that the challenged applicants received notification by mail; however, many applicants stated that they had received no  \b \i0 \ul0 [*8]\b0 \i0 \ul0   such notifications. n8 In addition, 14 other states--California, Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, Nevada, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia and Washington--have introduced legislation requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote. n9

\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  \b \i0 \ul0 [*2]\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b \i0 \ul0 SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Asian American \b0 \i \ul0 Amici\b0 \i0 \ul0  incorporate by reference the preemption arguments stated in the Brief of Respondents The Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, Inc. that Arizona's Proposition 200 is preempted by the NVRA and respectfully refer the Court to the Respondents' brief.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 We write to demonstrate to the Court that Proposition 200 is void because it creates unnecessary and discriminatory barriers to the fundamental right to vote, specifically for the Asian American community.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In 1993, Congress enacted the NVRA, which was \b \i0 \ul0 [**11]\b0 \i0 \ul0   designed, among other things, to eliminate "discriminatory and unfair registration laws and procedures [that] can have a direct and damaging effect on voter participation in elections for Federal office and disproportionately harm voter participation by various groups including racial minorities." 42 U.S.C. \'a7 1973gg(a)(3). To that end, Congress charged the Election Assistance Commission (the "EAC") with developing a federal voter-registration form for federal elections (the "Federal Form"), which would (i) specify voter eligibility requirements, including citizenship; and (ii) require the signature of the applicant under penalty of perjury. See \b0 \i \ul0 id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  \'a7 1973gg-7. The NVRA further required that "[e]ach State . . . accept and use" the Federal Form. \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  \'a7 1973gg-4(a)(1).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In 2004, despite the NVRA's "accept and use" requirement, Arizona enacted Proposition 200, which mandates that its local elections officials reject new voter applications unless applicants provide documentary proof of citizenship in addition to  \b \i0 \ul0 [*3]\b0 \i0 \ul0   completing the Federal Form. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  Ariz. Rev. Stat. \'a7\'a7 16-152, 16-166, 16-579 (LexisNexis 2011). According to its "findings \b \i0 \ul0 [**12]\b0 \i0 \ul0   and declaration" section, Proposition 200 was enacted to "declare that the public interest of [Arizona] requires all public agencies within [Arizona] to cooperate with federal immigration authorities to discourage illegal immigration," presumably to maintain the integrity of voting in Arizona. Instead, Proposition 200 greatly diminishes the integrity of the voting process by erecting barriers to voting for naturalized citizens, many of whom are minorities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In practice, the Arizona initiative makes it more difficult for naturalized citizens to register to vote. Proposition 200's call for "satisfactory evidence" of citizenship is a particularly high hurdle for the Asian American citizens of Arizona, approximately 40% of whom are naturalized. \b0 \i \ul0 See id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  \'a7 16-166(F). For example, under Proposition 200, although native-born citizens may simply mail copies of their U.S. birth certificates with their voter registration applications to register to vote, naturalized citizens must physically bring their original naturalization certificate, in person, to the voter registrar in Arizona. Additionally, a Naturalization Number (defined below), one of the forms of additional documentary proof \b \i0 \ul0 [**13]\b0 \i0 \ul0   of citizenship permitted under Proposition 200, cannot be verified with United States Citizenship and Immigration Services ("USCIS"), thus completely precluding that form of proof of citizenship. Instead of increasing the integrity of the voting process in Arizona, Proposition 200 limits voting access for actual citizens living in Arizona.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Proposition 200 Creates Barriers to Voting and Registration For Asian American Voters\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Justice O'Connor wrote that:
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0 The Constitution places the recently naturalized immigrant from a foreign land on an equal footing with those citizens of a State who are able to trace their lineage back for many generations within the State's borders.

All eligible citizens, either naturalized or native-born, have the right to vote, which is engrained in the principles and text of the United States Constitution. Proposition 200 unfairly places additional barriers to this right on naturalized citizens--burdens that are not borne by native-born citizens.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Historically, Asian Americans have faced significant discrimination and \b \i0 \ul0 [**14]\b0 \i0 \ul0   barriers to political participation. For example, legislative efforts have  \b \i0 \ul0 [*9]\b0 \i0 \ul0   limited the Asian American community's access to this country's borders. \b0 \i \ul0 See, e.g.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  Philippine Independence Act of 1934; Immigration Act of 1924, ch. 190,     43 Stat. 153 (denying entry to virtually all Asians; repealed 1952); Immigration Act of 1917, ch. 29,     39 Stat. 874, 874-98 (banning immigration from almost all countries in the Asia-Pacific region; repealed 1952). In 1868, just a few years before completion of the transcontinental railroad, the United States signed the Burlingame Treaty. n10 This treaty denied citizenship to the Chinese laborers who built the railroad, and barred the wives of day laborers from entering the United States. Congress later passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, n11 which barred Chinese immigration for 10 years. After the Act expired, additional legislation required all Chinese immigrants to register with the government and carry proof of residency. n12 Similar restrictions barred citizenship for Chinese women who were married to American citizens, n13 while the Cable Act n14 threatened to strip Chinese American women \b \i0 \ul0 [**15]\b0 \i0 \ul0   of citizenship if they married foreign-born Asians.

Magpantay, \b0 \i \ul0 Asian American Access to the Vote: The Language\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b \i0 \ul0 [**16]\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b0 \i \ul0  Assistance Provisions (Section 203) of the Voting Rights Act and Beyond,\b0 \i0 \ul0  11 Asian L.J. 31 (2004). Today, Proposition 200 perpetuates some of those same barriers. Additional documentation requirements diminish voter turnout and often result in apathy. See Shelley de Alth, \b0 \i \ul0 ID at the Polls: Assessing the Impact of Recent State Voter ID Laws on Voter Turnout,\b0 \i0 \ul0  3 Harv. L. & Pol'y Rev. 185, 193 (2009). This is particularly true given the history of discrimination discussed above, the high percentage of naturalized or "new" citizens among Asian Americans, and the lack of familiarity of new Asian American citizens with the voting process.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Rather than safeguarding the right to vote, Proposition 200 could deprive people who may rightfully exercise their right to vote from doing so. For example, under Proposition 200, native-born citizens may mail copies of their U.S. birth certificates to the county recorder, but naturalized citizens have no such option since they do not possess a United States birth certificate. Instead, to register, a naturalized citizen may provide a naturalization certificate in person (but not by mail) to the county recorder. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  Ariz.  \b \i0 \ul0 [**17]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Rev. Stat. \'a7 16-166(F)(4).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 These barriers to voter registration are disproportionately arduous to Asian Americans in Arizona, a high percentage of whom are naturalized  \b \i0 \ul0 [*11]\b0 \i0 \ul0   citizens. Of the estimated 194,475 Asian Americans living in Arizona, approximately 35.9% are foreign-born naturalized citizens. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  U.S. Census Native and Foreign-Born Populations Data. Thus, almost 40% of the Asian American community may encounter the challenges erected by Proposition 200 when attempting to register to vote. n15 In short, the barriers Asian American citizens encounter as a result of Proposition 200 have the effect of limiting political participation by the Asian American community. n16

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Second, Proposition 200 allows for naturalized citizens to register to vote by supplying their Naturalization Number. The parties do not dispute, however, that such number cannot be verified with the federal government and, therefore, any application that furnishes only the Naturalization Number would be automatically rejected. \b0 \i \ul0 See Gonzalez v. Arizona,\b0 \i0 \ul0  Nos. 08-17094, 08-17115 (9th Cir. filed Feb. 2, 2009), Opening Brief of Appellants Maria Gonzalez, et al., at 9-10, ECF No. 28 ("There is no dispute that the number of the certificate of naturalization cannot be verified with the federal government. Thus, no naturalized citizen can register by providing his or her naturalization  \b \i0 \ul0 [*12]\b0 \i0 \ul0   certificate number on the voter registration form.") (the "Gonzalez Ninth Circuit Opening Brief).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Third, many Asian Americans register to vote through community-based organizations, such as the Georgia-based Center for Pan Asian Community Services. Due to the confusion caused by the additional \b \i0 \ul0 [**19]\b0 \i0 \ul0   proof requirements, Proposition 200 hampers the ability of such organizations to conduct voter registration drives. As noted above, in Georgia (which has a law that closely resembles Proposition 200), 282 applicants had been flagged as requiring additional certification, much of which related to proof of citizenship for new Asian citizens. n17 Moreover, given that these organizations are community-based and often leanly staffed, it can be difficult for such organizations to help potential new registrants overcome the hurdles to registration erected by Proposition 200.
