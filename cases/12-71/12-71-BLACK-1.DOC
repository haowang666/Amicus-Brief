\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights is the nation's oldest and largest civil and human rights coalition, consisting of more than 210 national organizations charged with promoting and protecting the rights of all persons in the United States. The Leadership Conference was founded in 1950 by A. Philip Randolph, head of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters; Roy Wilkins of the NAACP; and Arnold Aronson, a leader of the National Jewish Community Relations Advisory Council. The Leadership Conference works to build an America that is inclusive and as good as its ideals.

ADL is vitally interested in protecting the civil rights of all persons, whether they are members of the minority or the majority, and in ensuring that each individual receives  \b \i0 \ul0 [*3]\b0 \i0 \ul0   equal treatment under the law regardless of race, ethnicity, or religion. Consistent with its mission, ADL opposes ballot access requirements that disproportionately affect the voting rights of racial or ethnic groups.

\par \pard 
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Recognized by this Court as the right that is "preservative of all rights," \b0 \i \ul0 Yick Wo v. Hopkins,\b0 \i0 \ul0  118 U.S. 356, 370 (1886), the right to vote is the cornerstone of our democracy. But America's relationship with the right to vote is a contested one, characterized by periods of expansion of the electorate often followed by efforts to contract voter access.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Against this historical backdrop, Congress enacted the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA) to expand America's promise of democracy by the People by making voter registration opportunities more widely available and, ultimately, politically engaging, among others, the most marginalized \b \i0 \ul0 [**11]\b0 \i0 \ul0   in our democracy: people of color and the poor. 42 U.S.C. \'a7\'a7 1973gg(a)(3), (b)(1). As intended by Congress, voter registration increased dramatically, with 20 million new voters, nearly half of whom were Black, registering between 1995 and June 1996. Widely recognized for its pivotal role in ushering in a new, but not complete, period of democratic expansion in this Nation, the NVRA also led to significant improvements in disparities in registration rates between people of color and Whites.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 As explained more fully below, however, following record participation by voters of color in several recent election cycles, and the substantial growth of communities of color in the last decade, several  \b \i0 \ul0 [*4]\b0 \i0 \ul0   states, including Arizona, have adopted voting measures to diminish access to the vote by people of color.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Between 2000 and 2010, the number of Latinos in Arizona increased substantially, by 600,000, and Latinos now comprise 30 percent of the state's population. Citing a need to combat undocumented immigration, Arizona responded by adopting Proposition 200. This discriminatory measure requires county registrars to reject any application for registration that \b \i0 \ul0 [**12]\b0 \i0 \ul0   is not accompanied by certain types of documentary evidence of United States citizenship. While citizenship is a legal requirement to register and vote, laws like Proposition 200 erect onerous documentary proof requirements that inhibit the registration of eligible voters.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Although Arizona failed to identify a single instance in which an undocumented immigrant registered to vote or voted in the state, the impact of the law was clear: following the enactment of Proposition 200, Arizona rejected the registration applications of more than 30,000 individuals. Of these, nearly 17 percent were Latinos. The Court of Appeals, sitting \b0 \i \ul0 en banc,\b0 \i0 \ul0  struck down Proposition 200 as applied to the Federal Form, a nationally uniform voter application that applicants can use to register by mail, recognizing that Proposition 200 was both inconsistent with and preempted by the NVRA.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Amici write separately to make three key points. \b0 \i \ul0 First,\b0 \i0 \ul0  this amicus brief provides the historical backdrop against which the NVRA was enacted and details various discriminatory measures that were employed by a number of states to prevent voters of color and the poor from exercising their voting  \b \i0 \ul0 [*5]\b0 \i0 \ul0   rights.  \b \i0 \ul0 [**13]\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b0 \i \ul0 Second,\b0 \i0 \ul0  this amicus brief describes the manner in which Congress, responding to this antidemocratic period of exclusion in American history, enacted the NVRA to usher in a period of electoral expansion. \b0 \i \ul0 Finally,\b0 \i0 \ul0  this brief argues that, absent full enforcement of the NVRA, measures such as Arizona's Proposition 200 will undermine the hardfought progress that has been made in combating discrimination in our political process.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Accordingly, amici respectfully urge this Court to uphold the ruling of the Court of Appeals.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 I. States have a long and well-documented history of discriminating against voters of color.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Nearly fifty years ago, in his speech proposing the bill that would become known as "the most successful piece of civil rights legislation ever adopted," Voting, U.S. Dep't of Justice, http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/ (last visited January 13, 2013), President Lyndon Johnson framed the challenge posed by our Nation's lamentable tradition of racial discrimination in voting:
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0 Many of the issues of civil rights are very complex and most difficult. But about this there can and should be no argument. Every American citizen must have \b \i0 \ul0 [**14]\b0 \i0 \ul0   an equal right to vote. There is no reason which can excuse the denial of that right. There is no duty which weighs more heavily on us than the duty we have to ensure that right.

Papers 281, 282 (Mar. 15, 1965), \b0 \i \ul0 available at\b0 \i0 \ul0  http://lbjlibrary.org/lyndon-baines-johnson/speeches-films/president-johnsons-special-message-to-the-congress-the-american-promise.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 As leading historians have explained, the extension of the right to vote in America has been contested, characterized by expansions often followed by swift contractions; gains in political participation by communities of color are too often met with corresponding efforts to constrict the franchise. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  Alexander Keyssar, \b0 \i \ul0 The Right to Vote: The Contested History of Democracy in the United States\b0 \i0 \ul0  xxiii (2009). The fight for the vote for Black Americans provides a prime example of this phenomenon. No other democracy in the world has enfranchised a large group, then disfranchised it--and then re-enfranchised it. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  Richard M. Valley, \b0 \i \ul0 The Two Reconstructions: The Struggle for Black Enfranchisement\b0 \i0 \ul0  1-2 (2004).  \b \i0 \ul0 [**15]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A. Early federal efforts to enfranchise Blacks during Reconstruction were later undermined by state election laws.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Following the Civil War, Congress moved swiftly to establish widespread Black suffrage. Between 1866 and 1867, the percentage of Black males eligible to vote "shot up from .5 percent to 80.5 percent, with all of the increase in the former Confederacy." Valley, \b0 \i \ul0 supra,\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 3.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 By 1870, the U.S. Constitution featured two new amendments, the Fourteenth and Fifteenth, enshrining the right to vote. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  U.S. Const. amend. XIV, amend. XV. With those constitutional amendments,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*7]\b0 \i0 \ul0   the first Reconstruction, a period of democratic expansion, was well underway. "Black office-holding emerged very rapidly" during Reconstruction. Valley, \b0 \i \ul0 supra,\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 3. "About half of the lower house of South Carolina's legislature . . . was [B]lack; 42 percent of Louisiana's lower [state] house was Black; and 29 percent of Mississippi's state house was Black." \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 But the abrupt end of Reconstruction in 1877 offers a bitter lesson about the consequences of failed political will to sustain comprehensive voting rights for voters of color. Following the demise of Reconstruction,  \b \i0 \ul0 [**16]\b0 \i0 \ul0   states and localities in the Old Confederacy engaged in decades of "unremitting and ingenious defiance of the Constitution," by promulgating numerous measures designed either to prevent Blacks from voting, or to cancel out the effect of the Black vote. \b0 \i \ul0 South Carolina v. Katzenbach,\b0 \i0 \ul0  383 U.S. 301,309(1966).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 By the 1890s, only "a generation after the great expansion in Black voting and office-holding," Southern legislatures "extinguish[ed] voting rights for the great majority" of Blacks, as Congress dismantled Reconstruction-era statutes. Valley, \b0 \i \ul0 supra,\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 3. Indeed, "[a] House report from the Fifty-third Congress (1893-1895) demanded that 'every trace of reconstruction measures be wiped from the books."' \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 1 (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 53-18, at 7 (1893)). Without the democratic protections of the Reconstruction-era statutes, discriminatory voting laws proliferated, as states implemented grandfather clauses, voter roll purges, poll taxes, strict voter identification requirements, and literacy and "understanding" tests--each of which was discriminatorily  \b \i0 \ul0 [*8]\b0 \i0 \ul0   enforced against Black voters at the polls. \b0 \i \ul0 See generally\b0 \i0 \ul0  Debo P. Adegbile, \b0 \i \ul0 Voting Rights\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b \i0 \ul0 [**17]\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b0 \i \ul0  in Louisiana: 1982-2006,\b0 \i0 \ul0  17 S. Cal. Rev. L. & Soc. Just. 413, 416-19 (2008) (tracing the history of voting rights discrimination in. Louisiana to the present day). Specifically, "'the key disfranchising features of the southern registration laws were the amount of discretion granted to the registrars, the specificity of the information required of the registrant, the times and places set for registration, and the requirement that a voter bring his registration certificate to the polling place.'" Mark Thomas Quinlivan, Comment, \b0 \i \ul0 One Person, One Vote Revisited: The Impending Necessity of Judicial Intervention in the Realm of Voter Registration,\b0 \i0 \ul0  137 U. Pa. L. Rev. 2361, 2368 (1989) (quoting J. M. Kousser, \b0 \i \ul0 The Shaping of Southern Politics: Suffrage Restriction and the Establishment of the One-Party South, 1880-1910\b0 \i0 \ul0  48 (1974)). To disfranchise voters of color further, states also tailored laws that disqualified people convicted of criminal offenses to apply to crimes thought to be committed by newly freed Blacks but not by Whites. \b0 \i \ul0 See \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Hunter v. Underwood,\b0 \i0 \ul0  471 U.S. 222, 224-27 (1985) (striking down Alabama's 1901 felon disfranchisement law because it \b \i0 \ul0 [**18]\b0 \i0 \ul0   was enacted with a discriminatory purpose); Lawyers' Comm. for Civil Rights Under Law & The Sentencing Project, \b0 \i \ul0 The Discriminatory Effects of Felony Disenfranchisement Laws, Policies and Practices on Minority Civic Participation in the United States\b0 \i0 \ul0  3-4 (2009), \b0 \i \ul0 available at\b0 \i0 \ul0  http://www.sentencingprject.org/doc/publications/publications/fd_UNMinorityForum.pdf.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In addition, states passed "second generation" barriers--a seamless continuation of the previous  \b \i0 \ul0 [*9]\b0 \i0 \ul0   discrimination, akin to "pour[ing] old poison into new bottles," \b0 \i \ul0 Reno v. Bossier Parish Sch. Bd.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  528 U.S. 320, 366 (2000) (Souter, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)--to prevent Black participation in voting. These efforts enabled county councils and school boards, for example, to use at-large elections to submerge newly registered minority voters within White majorities, draw racial gerrymanders, close or secretly move polling stations in minority neighborhoods, and employ countless other strategies to minimize the voting strength of voters of color. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  Chandler Davidson, \b0 \i \ul0 The Recent Evolution of Voting Rights Law Affecting Racial and Language Minorities, in Quiet Revolution\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b \i0 \ul0 [**19]\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b0 \i \ul0  in the South\b0 \i0 \ul0  21, 22-27 (Chandler Davidson & Bernard Grofman eds., 1993).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Together, these schemes reduced minority participation to insignificance. By the early 1900s, the racially discriminatory application of these laws resulted in the disfranchisement of 90 percent of Blacks in the Deep South. See James E. Alt, \b0 \i \ul0 The Impact of the Voting Rights Act on Black and White Voter Registration in the South, in Quiet Revolution in the South\b0 \i0 \ul0  351, 354-56 (Chandler Davidson & Bernard Grofman eds., 1993). "In Virginia, the black electorate was reduced from 147,000 to 21,000. In Mississippi, after adoption of the postReconstruction constitution, 6% of eligible Blacks were registered to vote. One percent of eligible African-Americans were registered to vote in Alabama by 1902, compared with 75% of Whites." Dayna L. Cunningham, \b0 \i \ul0 Who Are to Be the Electors? A Reflection on the History of Voter Registration in the United States,\b0 \i0 \ul0  9 Yale L. & Pol'y Rev. 370, 380 (1991).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360  \b \i0 \ul0 [*10]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Over the course of the 20th century, this Court slowly invalidated many of these state-sponsored discriminatory voting practices. Nevertheless, states continued to systematically exclude Blacks from the \b \i0 \ul0 [**20]\b0 \i0 \ul0   political process. \b0 \i \ul0 See, e.g., \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Dunn v. Blumstein,\b0 \i0 \ul0  405 U.S. 330, 359-60 (1972) (striking down durational residency requirements for voter registration in Tennessee); \b0 \i \ul0 Harper v. Va. State Bd. of Elections,\b0 \i0 \ul0  383 U.S. 663, 666 (1966) (declaring poll taxes an unconstitutional violation of the Equal Protection Clause); \b0 \i \ul0 Louisiana v. United States,\b0 \i0 \ul0  380 U.S. 145, 153 (1965) (striking down Louisiana's provision of an "interpretation test" to prospective voters as an unconstitutional device designed to disenfranchise Blacks); \b0 \i \ul0 Smith v. Allwright,\b0 \i0 \ul0  321 U.S. 649, 656-57, 664-65 (1944) (condemning the Democratic Party's practice of all-White primaries, which completely excluded Blacks from the political process).
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 B. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 abolished many of the barriers to full political participation for voters of color.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 March 7, 1965 was a turning point, and a defining moment for civil rights in this Nation. That day, millions of Americans had their television programs interrupted with images of law enforcement officers brutally assaulting Black men, women, and children on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama. The \b \i0 \ul0 [**21]\b0 \i0 \ul0   demonstrators were peacefully protesting a state trooper's killing of a young Black man during a voter registration event. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  David J.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 President Johnson described the now-infamous tactics employed to prevent Blacks from voting in the South, and he shared his first-hand experience witnessing discrimination against Mexican Americans in Texas.  \b \i0 \ul0 [**22]\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  He urged the passage of a new voting rights act, but recognized: "even if we pass this bill the battle will not be over." \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Congress responded by enacting the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA),     Pub. L. No. 89-110,     79 Stat. 937, a milestone in "the struggle to end discriminatory treatment of minorities who seek to exercise one of the most fundamental rights of our citizens: the right to vote." \b0 \i \ul0 Bartlett v. Strickland,\b0 \i0 \ul0  556 U.S. 1, 6 (2009). Widely regarded as the crowning achievement of the Civil Rights Movement, the VRA has proven to be one of the most successful federal civil rights statutes, if not statutes of any kind, in American history.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360  \b \i0 \ul0 [*12]\b0 \i0 \ul0   As a result of the VRA, Black registration rates rose dramatically and, consequently, the number of Black elected officials in this country increased nearly fivefold within five years after its passage.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The VRA helped to raise Black registration rates in the South to 60 percent by the late 1980s. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  Alt,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*13]\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b0 \i \ul0 supra,\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 354 & 374.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 These low registration and turnout rates were attributable \b \i0 \ul0 [**25]\b0 \i0 \ul0   in part to the restrictive registration laws that traced their origins to the discriminatory laws described above. \b0 \i \ul0 See, e.g.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  Cunningham, \b0 \i \ul0 supra,\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 385-86 ('"[R]egistration requirements are a more effective deterrent to voting than anything that normally operates to deter citizens from voting once they have registered, at least in presidential elections."') (quoting Stanley Kelley et al., \b0 \i \ul0 Registration and Voting: Putting First Things First,\b0 \i0 \ul0  61 Am. Pol. Sci. Rev. 359, 362 (1967)). In a study published in 1980, 82 percent of nonvoters explained that they did not vote because they were not registered. \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at  \b \i0 \ul0 [*14]\b0 \i0 \ul0   386 n.98 (citing William Crotty, \b0 \i \ul0 The Franchise: Registration Changes and Voter Representation, in Paths to Political Reform\b0 \i0 \ul0  67, 524 (1980)).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Before the passage of the NVRA, states, particularly in the South, prohibited absentee voter registration, permitted only county registrars or their deputies to register voters, limited registration to the least convenient hours for potential voters, and maintained registrar locations far from where many voters lived. \b0 \i \ul0 See, e.g.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  Alt, \b0 \i \ul0 supra,\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 356 ("Even in 1970, of the eleven southern states only Tennessee \b \i0 \ul0 [**26]\b0 \i0 \ul0   and Texas had any provision for absentee registration, although twenty-seven of the thirty-nine nonsouthern states had such provisions."); Cunningham, \b0 \i \ul0 supra,\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 386 & n.99 (noting that "[i]n some rural areas where only one site is used for voter registration, potential voters . . . must travel distances of over 100 miles to register"); Quinlivan, \b0 \i \ul0 supra,\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 2374-75 & n.93 (listing states that give the local registrars discretion to appoint deputies; "this practice results more often in greater power to inhibit registration than in increases in the ease of registration"). To make matters worse, forty states and the District of Columbia permitted purges of voters from registration rolls if those voters did not participate in a certain number of past elections. \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 2374.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 These barriers to registration disproportionately impacted, and often were originally intended to target, voters of color and the poor, many of whom lacked access to transportation to travel long distances at inconvenient times to register to vote. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  Lani Guinier, \b0 \i \ul0 Keeping the Faith: Black Voters in the Post-Reagan Era,\b0 \i0 \ul0  24 Harv. C.R.-C.L. L. Rev. 393, 419-20 (1989). For instance,  \b \i0 \ul0 [**27]\b0 \i0 \ul0   the 1980 Census found  \b \i0 \ul0 [*15]\b0 \i0 \ul0   that 42 percent of Blacks, but only 9 percent of Whites, lacked access to transportation in rural Arkansas. \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 419 (citing U.S. Dep't of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Statistical Abstracts of the U.S. Table 96, Arkansas 5-117-119 (1988)). n3 Moreover, people of color and the poor relied more heavily than Whites on voter registration drives--which were disfavored in many jurisdictions. \b0 \i \ul0 See, e.g., \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 NAACP, DeKalb Cnty. Chapter v. Georgia,\b0 \i0 \ul0  494 F. Supp. 668, 670 & n.2, 673 (N.D. Ga. 1980) ("During the month of January, 1980, at all DeKalb County voter registration sites, 2,700 people were registered. On the other hand, during a one-day voter registration drive conducted by plaintiff League [of Women Voters] . . . approximately one and one-half times as many people were registered"); \b0 \i \ul0 cf.\b0 \i0 \ul0  Alt, \b0 \i \ul0 supra,\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 368 (noting that, by 1968, 60 percent of Blacks in southern majority-minority counties visited by federal examiners  \b \i0 \ul0 [*16]\b0 \i0 \ul0   were registered to vote, whereas only 28 percent of Blacks were registered in similar, but unvisited counties).
\par \pard 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n3 The discriminatory impact of those state registration laws that required voters to travel long distances to register to vote is strikingly similar to that of Texas's voter photo identification law, which was rejected by a federal district court because it, among other things, required some rural voters to travel distances of over 200 miles to obtain acceptable identification. \b0 \i \ul0 Texas v. Holder,\b0 \i0 \ul0  No. 12-128, 2012 WL 3743676, at *27-29 (D.D.C. Aug. 30, 2012).

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Finally, purges of voter registration lists also disproportionately affected voters of color and the poor because they were more likely to be inactive voters, to move inter-county between elections, or to be under-educated and, thus, less likely to respond to letters requesting that they update their registration. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  S. Rep.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 VRA litigation successfully challenged some, but not all, of these registration barriers. \b0 \i \ul0 See, e.g., \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Miss.

Mabus,\b0 \i0 \ul0  932 F.2d 400, 401, 412-13 (5th Cir. 1991) (affirming a district court's finding that Mississippi's dual registration system and prohibition on satellite registration violated the VRA and affirming the steps taken by the district court to cure those violations); \b0 \i \ul0 see also \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 NAACP, DeKalb Cnty.

During the same period, many in Congress recognized that broader, more meaningful voter registration laws were needed, and over the next 20 years introduced more than 44 reform bills. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  Cunningham, \b0 \i \ul0 supra,\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 387-88 (discussing the various proposed  \b \i0 \ul0 [*17]\b0 \i0 \ul0   bills); Gemmiti, \b0 \i \ul0 supra,\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 89-94 (describing efforts to enact voter registration reform).

\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0 the eradication of a rather unfortunate tradition in this country. We \b \i0 \ul0 [**30]\b0 \i0 \ul0   have used voter registration mechanisms in the United States throughout many, many decades to prevent various groups who were from time to time and by certain groups considered undesirable, to make it very difficult for them to vote.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A. The NVRA is a civil rights statute designed to increase voter registration among people of color and the poor.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The NVRA sought to eliminate barriers to registration and to affirmatively "increase the number of eligible citizens who register to vote in elections for  \b \i0 \ul0 [*18]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Federal office." 42 U.S.C. \'a7 1973gg(b)(1). It was also adopted as a special effort to reach "the poor and persons with disabilities who do not have driver's licenses and will not come into contact with [motor vehicle agencies]." H.R. Rep. No. 103-66, at 19 (1993) (Conf. Rep.), \b0 \i \ul0 reprinted in\b0 \i0 \ul0  1993 U.S.C.C.A.N. 140.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In particular, the NVRA requires states to make registration available: (1) "by application made simultaneously with an application \b \i0 \ul0 [**31]\b0 \i0 \ul0   for a motor vehicle driver's license," 42 U.S.C. \'a7 1973gg-2(a)(1); (2) "by mail application" using the Federal Form prescribed by the Election Assistance Commission (EAC), 42 U.S.C. \'a7\'a7 1973gg-2(a)(2), 1973gg-4; and (3) "by application in person" at sites designated in accordance with state law or state voter registration agencies, \b0 \i \ul0 id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  \'a7 1973gg-2(a)(3). The Federal Form--a nationally uniform voter application that applicants can use to register by mail, \b0 \i \ul0 id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  \'a7\'a7 1973gg-4, 1973gg-7(a)(2)--was in part designed to facilitate registration drives.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Section 7 of the NVRA sets forth further obligations of certain state offices as "voter registration agencies." H.R. Rep. No. 103-66, at 18-20; \b0 \i \ul0 see also\b0 \i0 \ul0  42 U.S.C. \'a7 1973gg-5. Section 7(a)(6) of the NVRA requires all state offices that provide Medicaid, food stamps, and other public assistance benefits, to provide their clients "a mail voter registration application form," and assistance completing the voter registration form, "with each application for [public] service or assistance, and with each recertification, renewal,  \b \i0 \ul0 [**32]\b0 \i0 \ul0   or change of address form relating to such service or assistance." 42 U.S.C. \'a7 1973gg-5(a)(6). The NVRA, which passed with broad bipartisan support  \b \i0 \ul0 [*19]\b0 \i0 \ul0   and was signed into law by President Bill Clinton on May 20, 1993, Gemmiti, \b0 \i \ul0 supra,\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 95-96, also established limitations on voter purges. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  42 U.S.C. \'a7 1973gg-6(d).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Significantly, in passing the NVRA, Congress recognized that "discriminatory and unfair registration laws and procedures can have a direct and damaging effect on voter participation in elections for Federal office and disproportionately harm voter participation by various groups, including racial minorities." \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  \'a7 1973gg(a)(3). In that spirit, Congress took steps to ensure that the NVRA could not be used by states to enact discriminatory laws, like Arizona's Proposition 200. In the Joint House-Senate Conference, members of Congress expressly rejected language from the bill that would have given states the power to require individuals to provide documentary proof of citizenship in order to register to vote. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  Gemmiti, \b0 \i \ul0 supra,\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 95 n.252 (citing Richard Sammon, \b0 \i \ul0 Deal May Speed Up "Motor\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b \i0 \ul0 [**33]\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b0 \i \ul0  Voter,"\b0 \i0 \ul0  Cong.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 As intended by Congress, voter registration increased dramatically following the NVRA's passage, with 20 million new registrants, 9 million of whom were Black, being added to the voter registration rolls between 1995 and June 1996. See Robert Brown & Justin Wedeking, \b0 \i \ul0 People Who Have Their Tickets But Do Not Use Them: "Motor Voter," Registration, and Turnout Revisited,\b0 \i0 \ul0  34 Am. Pol. Res. 479, 484-87 (2006); Gemmiti, \b0 \i \ul0 supra,\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 97. Widely recognized for its pivotal role in ushering in a new period  \b \i0 \ul0 [*20]\b0 \i0 \ul0   of democratic expansion in this country, the NVRA led to significant improvements in disparities in registration rates between people of color and Whites. See Gemmiti, \b0 \i \ul0 supra,\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 97.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Efforts to enforce the NVRA in states have also led to dramatic increases in voter registration in more recent years. In 2004, for example, Iowa improved its agency-based voter registration and experienced a 700 percent increase in registrations over the previous presidential election cycle as well as a 3,000 \b \i0 \ul0 [**34]\b0 \i0 \ul0   percent increase over the previous year. See Estelle H. Rogers, \b0 \i \ul0 The National Voter Registration Act: Fifteen Years On\b0 \i0 \ul0  2 (2009), \b0 \i \ul0 available at\b0 \i0 \ul0  www.acslaw.org/sites/default/files/Rogers_NVR_at_15.pdf.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Other states, however, have sought to frustrate the dictates of the NVRA, through measures similar to Arizona's Proposition 200, and have been required to comply with the statute by court order. Missouri, for example, was compelled by a district court to comply with the NVRA. \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  Following the implementation of the court order, state public assistance agencies collected 26,000 voter registration applications in just six weeks. \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 And just last year, LDF won partial summary judgment in a challenge to Louisiana's failure to comply with the NVRA, with a court holding that the NVRA requires that all public assistance clients be provided with a voter registration application, whether they seek benefits in person or remotely by the internet, telephone, or mail. \b0 \i \ul0 Ferrand v. Schedler,\b0 \i0 \ul0  No. 11-926, 2012 WL 1570094, at *12 (E.D. La. May 3, 2012). In Louisiana, registrations from public assistance agencies had plummeted 88 percent  \b \i0 \ul0 [*21]\b0 \i0 \ul0   since the NVRA was first \b \i0 \ul0 [**35]\b0 \i0 \ul0   implemented, from 75,000 in 1995 to 1996 to a mere 9,000 in 2007 to 2008. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  Pls.'

After LDF filed this lawsuit, however, voter registrations through public assistance offices spiked, with the number of new registrations increasing as much as sevenfold from previous years. \b0 \i \ul0 See id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 8-9.

Notably, in 2008, after the U.S. Department of Justice raised concerns about the Arizona Department of Economic Security's compliance with Section 7,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*22]\b0 \i0 \ul0   the parties entered into an agreement establishing standards to ensure the proper implementation of the NVRA. \b0 \i \ul0 See Agreement Between the United States Department of Justice and the Arizona Department of Economic Security Concerning Standards and Monitoring of Compliance with the National Voter Registration Act of 1993\b0 \i0 \ul0  (May 15, 2008), http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/nvra/az_nvr_moa.php.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The prominent role that the NVRA has played in increasing registration and turnout rates among lowincome voters, who are disproportionately persons of color, is significant. Between 2007 and 2010, an astonishing one million low-income people in five different \b \i0 \ul0 [**37]\b0 \i0 \ul0   states registered to vote as a result of NVRA enforcement. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  Youjin B.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 III. Arizona's Proposition 200 is inconsistent with and preempted by the National Voter Registration Act.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Notwithstanding the long, exclusive, and sad history of voting discrimination in response to which Congress enacted the NVRA, and the important strides toward equality in the voter registration process that the NVRA has occasioned, Arizona has sought to return to the pre-NVRA era--and even the pre-VRA era--by mounting an assault on the voting rights of people of color, and Latinos in particular, through Proposition 200.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360  \b \i0 \ul0 [*23]\b0 \i0 \ul0   As noted earlier, between 2000 and 2010, the number of Latinos in Arizona grew significantly, by almost 600,000, from less than 1.3 million to approximately 1.9 million. \b0 \i \ul0 The State of the Right to Vote After the 2012 Election: Hearing Before the S. Comm. on the Judiciary,\b0 \i0 \ul0  112th Cong. (2012) (statement of Nina Perales,  \b \i0 \ul0 [**38]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Vice President of Litigation, Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund) [hereinafter \b0 \i \ul0 Senate Hearing]\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 1, \b0 \i \ul0 available at\b0 \i0 \ul0  http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/pdf/12-12-19PeralesTestimony.pdf. Latinos now comprise 30 percent of the state's population. \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  In response to this demographic trend, Arizona voters, citing a need to combat undocumented immigration, adopted Proposition 200, a discriminatory measure that requires county registrars to "reject any application for registration that is not accompanied by satisfactory evidence of United States citizenship." Ariz. Rev. Stat. \'a7 16-166(F).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 For its part, Arizona failed to identify a single instance in which an undocumented immigrant registered or voted in the state. \b0 \i \ul0 Senate Hearing, supra,\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 3 (statement of Perales). The impact of the law was significant, however. Following the enactment of Proposition 200, Arizona rejected the registration applications of more than 30,000 individuals. See \b0 \i \ul0 Gonzalez v. Arizona,\b0 \i0 \ul0  No. 06-1268, slip op. at 13 (D. Ariz. Aug. 20, 2008). Nearly 17 percent of those rejected were Latinos, a figure measurably higher than the almost 14 percent of Latinos in the original registration \b \i0 \ul0 [**39]\b0 \i0 \ul0   applicant pool. \b0 \i \ul0 See id.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Proposition 200 is foreclosed by the NVRA. \b0 \i \ul0 See \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Gonzalez v. Arizona,\b0 \i0 \ul0  677 F.3d 383, 388 (9th Cir. 2012) (en banc). As discussed above, Congress ensured  \b \i0 \ul0 [*24]\b0 \i0 \ul0   that the NVRA could not be used by states to enact discriminatory laws, like Arizona's Proposition 200. Congress specifically rejected language in the bill that would have given states the power to selectively require individuals to provide documentary proof of citizenship in order to register to vote. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  Gemmiti, \b0 \i \ul0 supra,\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 95 n.252 (citing Sammon, \b0 \i \ul0 supra,\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 1080). In so doing, Congress also sought to prevent states from discriminating against voters with "foreign sounding" names. \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The NVRA's preemption of discriminatory measures like Proposition 200 is especially important for Latinos in Arizona, who comprise the state's fastestgrowing citizen voting-age population and who are engulfed in an often heated debate about immigrants from Mexico living in the state. \b0 \i \ul0 Senate Hearing, supra,\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 3 (statement of Perales). As Latinos in Arizona, and people of color more broadly, strive to overcome the effects of past exclusion from the political process, measures like \b \i0 \ul0 [**40]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Proposition 200 undermine that effort. Fortunately, the Court of Appeals, sitting \b0 \i \ul0 en banc,\b0 \i0 \ul0  struck down Proposition 200, correctly recognizing that it was both inconsistent with and preempted by the NVRA. \b0 \i \ul0 Gonzalez,\b0 \i0 \ul0  677 F.3d at 388.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Democracy in America is contested and has been characterized by periods of progress and retrenchment. For nearly a century before the enactment of the VRA and NVRA, many jurisdictions held tightly to discriminatory practices that excluded people of color from equal political participation. The NVRA ushered in a period of democratic expansion and has been extraordinarily effective at leading our nation toward becoming a more inclusive democracy. Arizona's  \b \i0 \ul0 [*25]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Proposition 200, and other similar efforts that recall the discriminatory laws of the last century, threaten to undermine the hard-fought progress of the last fifty years.
