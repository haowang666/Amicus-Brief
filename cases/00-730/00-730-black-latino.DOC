\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 STATEMENT OF FACTS\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In response to persistent racial and gender discrimination in the construction industry, Congress enacted the DBE program to encourage the participation of minority- and women-owned businesses in federal contracting. See, e.g., 144 Cong. Rec.  \b \i0 \ul0 [**8]\b0 \i0 \ul0   S1402 (daily ed. Mar. 5, 1998) (statement of Sen. Baucus). The DBE program, currently authorized by Section 1101(b) of TEA-21, n2 directs that at least 10 percent of funds appropriated for federal transportation projects should be spent with "small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals." Pub. L. No. 105-178, \'a7 1101(b). An individual is "socially disadvantaged" under the statute if he or she has been "subjected to racial or ethnic prejudice or cultural bias because of" his or her "identity as a member of a group without regard to . . . individual qualities." 15 U.S.C. \'a7 637(a)(5). An individual is considered "economically disadvantaged" if he or she is "socially disadvantaged" and his or her "ability to compete in the free enterprise system has been impaired due to diminished capital and credit  \b \i0 \ul0 [*3]\b0 \i0 \ul0   opportunities as compared to others in the same business area who are not socially disadvantaged." 15 U.S.C. \'a7 637(a)(6)(A). The statute affords certain minority and female contractors a presumption of disadvantage in the highway construction industry. n3 Pub. L. No. 105-178, \'a7 1101(b).  \b \i0 \ul0 [**9]\b0 \i0 \ul0   The presumption is rebuttable and subject to challenge by any person. 49 C.F.R. \'a7 26.87.
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n2 The DBE program was established in 1980 by regulation under the authority of certain federal nondiscrimination statutes. See Participation by Disadvantaged Business Enterprises in DOT Programs, 64 Fed. Reg. 5096 (Feb. 2, 1999) (Final Rule). In 1983, Congress enacted--and President Ronald Reagan signed--the first statutory DBE program, which applied primarily to minority-owned businesses. See Surface Transportation Assistance Act (STAA), Pub. L. No. 97-424, 96 Stat. 2097. In 1987, through the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act (STURAA), Pub. L. No. 100-17, 101 Stat. 132, Congress expanded the program to include women-owned businesses. In 1991, Congress passed legislation, endorsed and signed by President George Bush, that reauthorized the DBE program. See Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA), Pub. L. No. 102-240, 105 Stat. 1914. On June 9, 1998, Congress enacted TEA-21.
\par \fs20 \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n3 In addition to those presumed to be disadvantaged, any business owner--regardless of race or gender--may demonstrate social or economic disadvantage and, consequently, qualify for DBE status. 49 C.F.R. \'a7 26.67. In fact, businesses owned by white males, including Petitioner \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Adarand Constructors,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Inc., have qualified for the DBE designation. See 144 Cong. Rec. S1427 (daily ed. Mar. 5, 1998) (statement of Sen. Domenici) (quoting Letter to Sen. Domenici from Secretary Slater and Attorney General Reno).
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  \b \i0 \ul0 [**10]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The United States Department of Transportation (DOT), which administers the DBE program, has promulgated regulations to prevent the designation as DBEs of firms that are not in fact disadvantaged. Toward that end, all individuals claiming to be disadvantaged--including "presumptively disadvantaged owner[s]"--must certify that they are in fact socially and economically disadvantaged within the meaning of the statute and its regulations. Id. \'a7 26.67(a)(1) (requiring submission of signed, notarized certification), and provide proof of personal net worth, id. \'a7 26.67(a)(2). If the individual's personal net worth exceeds a regulatory limit of $ 750,000, or if the individual is not in fact socially and economically disadvantaged, the presumption of disadvantage is rebutted. Id. \'a7 26.67(b).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Once certified, DBEs are eligible for participation in the DBE program. Under the program, state and local recipients of DOT financial assistance are required to determine the expected level of DBE participation in their area "absent the effects of discrimination," Id. \'a7 26.45(b), and set their own goals for DBE participation based on local market conditions  \b \i0 \ul0 [*4]\b0 \i0 \ul0   and contractor availability.  \b \i0 \ul0 [**11]\b0 \i0 \ul0   n4 A recipient then submits to DOT its proposal to achieve its overall participation goal. Id. \'a7 26.21. This proposal often consists largely of race-neutral measures, but may also include race-conscious measures n5 as a last resort. Id. \'a7 26.51(d). If a recipient determines that it can meet its goal without considering race, it must do so. Id. \'a7 26.51(f)(1).
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n4 These goals are not based on the 10 percent national goal articulated in the statute; indeed, the regulations counsel against reliance on the national goal. 49 C.F.R. \'a7 26.45; see also 64 Fed. Reg. at 5109 (noting that recipients of DOT financial assistance must have regional participation goals); H.R. Rep. No. 105-467, Part 1, at 504 (stating that 10 percent goal "is a national target for DOT; state and local recipients of DOT funding set their own goals for DOT participation in construction projects based on the availability of disadvantaged businesses in their market").
\par \fs20 \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n5 For example, in 2000, nine of the state recipients of federal highway assistance employed no race-conscious measures at all, and no state recipient of such assistance employed only race-conscious measures. See U.S. Dep't of Transportation, FHWA State DBE Goals FY 2001 (July 25, 2001) at http://osdbuweb.dot.gov/business/dbe/fhwagoal.html.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The DBE program, while designed to encourage the use of minority- and women-owned businesses, specifically prohibits recipients' use of quotas. Id. \'a7 26.43(a); see also 144 Cong. Rec. S1427 (daily ed. Mar. 5, 1998) (statement of Sen. Domenici) (quoting Letter to Sen. Domenici from Secretary Slater and Attorney General Reno). Indeed, Senator Baucus, one of the floor managers of TEA-21 and ranking member of the committee of jurisdiction, confirmed that no quotas may be used n6 and that the contract goals are  \b \i0 \ul0 [*5]\b0 \i0 \ul0   not binding: "If a contractor makes good faith efforts to find qualified women or minority-owned subcontractors, but fails to meet the goal, there is no penalty." 144 Cong. Rec. S1403 (daily ed. Mar. 5, 1998). n7 Consequently, no contractor should ever lose a bid merely because it failed to satisfy minority participation goals.  64 Fed. Reg. at 5098.
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n6 Similarly, Senator Robb observed during floor debate on the measure, "this program is not a 'quota program,' as some have suggested. There is a great difference between an aspirational goal and a rigid numerical requirement. Quotas utilize rigid numerical requirements as a means of implementing a program. The DBE program uses aspirational goals." 144 Cong. Rec. S1425 (daily ed. Apr. 1, 1998).

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In 1995, this Court addressed an earlier version of the DBE program in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Adarand Constructors,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200 (1995). The Court did not reach the constitutionality of the program but held that strict scrutiny applies to all race-based classifications--whether imposed by federal, state, or local government, id. at 227--and remanded the case for a determination whether the program satisfied that standard of review, id. at 237. The Court emphasized that strict scrutiny should not be "strict in theory, but fatal in fact." Id.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In response to the Court's decision in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Adarand,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Congress and DOT modified the DBE program. While the relevant statutory language has remained essentially \b \i0 \ul0 [**14]\b0 \i0 \ul0   the same, the federal government has significantly changed the way it implements the DBE program. See \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Adarand Constructors,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Inc. v. Slater, 228 F.3d 1147, 1155 (10th Cir. 2000). Indeed, Congress re-enacted the DBE program in TEA-21 with the express understanding that the relevant agencies would promulgate regulations designed to satisfy the Court's equal protection standards. n8 Those implementing regulations,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*6]\b0 \i0 \ul0   described above, were published on February 2, 1999. See 64 Fed. Reg. 5096.

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Before DOT issued its revised regulations, the district court on remand found that the government had established a compelling interest to justify the DBE program but that the then-existing program was insufficiently tailored to satisfy strict scrutiny review.  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Adarand Constructors,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Inc. v. Pena, 965 F. Supp. 1556, 1581-83 (D.

The Tenth Circuit went on to consider the revised regulations for the DBE program, which had been promulgated after the district court decision.  Id. at 1158-59. The court concluded that, while certain provisions of the old DBE program were not narrowly tailored, the revised regulations had cured the earlier deficiencies.  Id. at 1187. The court therefore held that the current DBE program is narrowly tailored to further compelling interests. Id.

\par \pard 
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Congress has compelling interests in remedying racial discrimination and its effects, and in avoiding the use of federal funds to perpetuate such discrimination and its effects. Toward that end, Congress collected and considered extensive testimony, reports, statistical evidence, and social \b \i0 \ul0 [**16]\b0 \i0 \ul0   science data documenting persistent racial discrimination in public contracting and the construction industry. Having  \b \i0 \ul0 [*7]\b0 \i0 \ul0   assembled substantial record evidence of such discrimination, Congress established and reauthorized the DBE program and, in so doing, acted well within its constitutional authority under the Civil War Amendments.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Furthermore, DOT promulgated revised regulations to tailor the operation of the DBE program narrowly to the interests Congress sought to address. Closely considering this Court's decision in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Adarand,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  DOT crafted the new program with the express intent of complying with the equal protection standards articulated therein. Indeed, the new DBE program far exceeds the Court's requirements: the program mandates use of race-neutral measures to satisfy minority participation goals; is designed to last no longer than is necessary to address the discrimination and lingering effects of such discrimination that Congress identified; incorporates an individualized inquiry into disadvantage for every firm designated as a DBE; and only minimally impacts third parties.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 ARGUMENT\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 I. THE DBE PROGRAM FURTHERS THE COMPELLING INTERESTS IN REMEDYING THE\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b \i0 \ul0 [**17]\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b \i0 \ul0  EFFECTS OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY AND PREVENTING THE GOVERNMENT'S SUPPORT FOR, OR PERPETUATION OF, SUCH DISCRIMINATION.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This Court stated in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Adarand\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that "the unhappy persistence of both the practice and the lingering effects of racial discrimination against minority groups in this country is an unfortunate reality, and government is not disqualified from acting in response to it." 515 U.S. at 237. Consistent with the authority it has to determine the scope of remedial legislation, Congress enacted the DBE program both to remedy the effects of persistent racial discrimination in the  \b \i0 \ul0 [*8]\b0 \i0 \ul0   construction industry and to prevent its perpetuation through the distribution of federal funds. n9
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n9 We do not analyze separately the gender-specific aspects of TEA-21, because the questions before the Court do not implicate the less rigorous standard of intermediate scrutiny that is applicable to gender classifications. See United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 532-33 (1996).

\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0 A. Under established precedent, Congress has compelling interests in preventing government support for, and addressing the effects of, racial\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b \i0 \ul0 [**18]\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b \i0 \ul0  discrimination.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 It is well-established that Congress has compelling interests in remedying the effects of private discrimination in the construction industry, and in preventing the perpetuation of these effects by the distribution of federal funds. See id. at 222, 237; City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 491-92, 503 (1989). n10 In Croson, for example, the Court applied strict scrutiny to a municipal contracting plan that required prime contractors to subcontract at least 30 percent of each contract to minority business enterprises.  488 U.S. at 493-94. While the Court decided that the city had not made a sufficient showing of discrimination, a majority of the Court made clear that, had such a showing been made, the government "would have a compelling interest in preventing its tax dollars from assisting these organizations in maintaining a racially segregated construction market." Id. at 503. n11 Similarly, Justice O'Connor stated that "it is beyond  \b \i0 \ul0 [*9]\b0 \i0 \ul0   dispute that any public entity, state or federal, has a compelling interest in assuring that public dollars, drawn from the tax contributions of all citizens, do not \b \i0 \ul0 [**19]\b0 \i0 \ul0   serve to finance the evil of private prejudice." Id. at 492. n12

\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n10 See also Croson, 488 U.S. at 518 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (noting that "the State has the power to eradicate racial discrimination and its effects in both the public and private sectors, and the absolute duty to do so where those wrongs were caused intentionally by the State itself"); Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497 U.S. 547, 610-11 (1990) (O'Connor, J., dissenting).
\par \fs20 \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n11 Justice O'Connor was joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice White. Additionally, the dissenting Justices agreed that a governmental entity has a compelling interest in "preventing the city's own spending decisions from reinforcing and perpetuating the exclusionary effects of past discrimination." Croson, 488 U.S. at 537; see also Concrete Works of Colorado, Inc. v. City and County of Denver, 36 F.3d 1513, 1519, 1529 (10th Cir. 1994); Coral Constr. Co. v. King County, 941 F.2d 910, 916 (9th Cir. 1991).
\par \fs20 \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n12 Indeed, every court that has considered the constitutionality of raceconscious federal contracting programs since this Court's decision in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Adarand\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has ruled that they are supported by a compelling governmental interest.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This Court has long held that it violates principles of equal protection for the government to support, encourage or give effect to discrimination practiced by private parties. See Gilmore v. City of Montgomery, 417 U.S. 556, 572-74 (1974); see also Norwood v. Harrison, 413 U.S. 455, 465 (1973); Reitman v. Mulkey, 387 U.S. 369, 381 (1967); Burton v. Wilmington Parking Auth., 365 U.S. 715, 722, 725 (1961); Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1, 19 (1948). In Norwood v. Harrison (on which the Court expressly relied in Croson), the Court concluded that the Constitution requires a governmental entity "to steer clear, not only of operating the old dual system of racially segregated schools, but also of giving significant aid to institutions that practice racial or other invidious discrimination." 413 U.S. at 467; see also id. at 465 ("Racial discrimination in state-operated schools is barred by the Constitution and 'it is also axiomatic that a state may not induce, encourage or promote private persons to accomplish what it is constitutionally forbidden to accomplish.'")

(prohibiting discrimination in "any program or activity receiving Federal Financial Assistance").
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Similarly, the government has a compelling interest in acting to prevent or avoid unconstitutional or unlawful conduct. See Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ., 476 U.S. 267, 290-91 (1986) (O'Connor, J., concurring) (citing United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburgh, Inc. v. Carey, 430 U.S. 144, 165-66 (1977), and McDaniel v.

Vigilance is required to avoid the unconstitutional or unlawful use of government funds: "the Court has never attempted to formulate 'an infallible test for determining whether the State . . . has become significantly involved in private discriminations' so as to constitute state action. 'Only by sifting facts and weighing circumstances' (on a case-by-case basis) can the 'non-obvious involvement \b \i0 \ul0 [**22]\b0 \i0 \ul0   of the State in private conduct be attributed its true significance.'" Gilmore, 417 U.S. at 572-74 (quoting Reitman, 387 U.S. at 378, and Burton, 365 U.S. at 722). Congress also has authority under the Thirteenth Amendment to eliminate private racial discrimination and its effects in contracts and business relations. n13

Congress is authorized by Section 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment to effectuate its guarantees in the same manner as Section 5 mandates securing the guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment. See Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U.S. 409, 439-40 (1968); see also Croson, 488 U.S. at 490. Congress appropriately has acted to remedy and prevent private discrimination in contracts through the Reconstruction Civil Rights Acts, 42 U.S.C. \'a7\'a7 1981 and 1982. See, e.g., Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., 421 U.S. 454 (1975). That same interest is served when Congress exercises its authority to define the conditions on which federal funds will be introduced into the construction industry. See Fullilove v.

Congress determined that the federal government, through its massive infusion of federal funds into the national highway construction industry, n14 had become a participant in a system of racial exclusion. See Proposed Reforms to Affirmative Action in Federal Procurement, 61 Fed. Reg. 26,042, 26,062 (May 23, 1996). Thus, Congress justifiably took affirmative steps to avoid its further involvement in perpetuating a discriminatory system. As the Tenth Circuit stated, "the Constitution does not obligate Congress to stand idly by and continue to pour money into an industry so shaped by the effects of discrimination that the profits to be derived from congressional appropriations accrue exclusively to the beneficiaries, however personally innocent, of the effects of racial prejudice." \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Adarand,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  228 F.3d at 1176. Nor does the Constitution require "Congress to acquiesce in the workings of an ostensibly free market that would direct the profits to be gleaned from disbursements of public funds to non-minorities alone." Id. at 1175. \b \i0 \ul0 [**24]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Were this not true, the federal government would be in the untenable position of endorsing racial discrimination in the construction industry by providing economic support ensuring its continuation.

See Metro Broadcasting, 497 U.S. at 605-06 (O'Connor, J., dissenting).

Because of these unique powers, the Chief Justice concluded that 'Congress not only may induce voluntary action to assure compliance with existing federal statutory or constitutional antidiscrimination provisions, but also, where Congress has authority to declare certain conduct unlawful, it may, as here, authorize and induce state action to avoid such conduct.

See Katzenbach v.

As the Court stated in Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, "Congress' power 'to enforce' the [Fourteenth] Amendment includes the authority both to remedy and to deter violation of rights guaranteed thereunder by prohibiting a somewhat broader swath of conduct, including that which is not itself forbidden by the Amendment's text." 528 U.S. 62, 81 (2000) (emphasis added). n17

Boerne, 521 U.S. at 519; see also Kimel, 528 U.S. at 85-91. Because state discrimination and involvement in private discrimination are directly prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment, and since Congress has the power to prohibit private discrimination under the Thirteenth Amendment--which it appropriately has done with respect to the right to contract, see Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U.S. 409, 441-43 (1968)--virtually all of the conduct regulated by the DBE program would likely be unconstitutional or unlawful. n18 The fact that the legislation also regulates some constitutional conduct does not render it  \b \i0 \ul0 [*15]\b0 \i0 \ul0   beyond the scope of Congress' authority; n19 it is sufficient that the record establish only a "strong basis in evidence," "approaching a prima facie case of a constitutional or statutory violation."

For example, this Court has found certain legislation an appropriate exercise of Congress' Section 5 enforcement power, even though it contained discriminatory impact provisions not mandated by the Constitution.

By reauthorizing the DBE program again this year, Congress has signaled its belief that . . . we need this program if we are to remove the continuing barriers confronted by minority- and women-owned businesses." 144 Cong. Rec. S5403-04, S5414 (daily ed. May 22, 1998). Through its system of reauthorization, Congress resolved that it should take affirmative steps to ensure compliance with existing legislation, as well as to avoid its complicity in a system of racial exclusion. n22 See \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Adarand,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  228 F.3d at 1166-68 (noting that Congress' extensive debate regarding renewal of DBE program before passing TEA-21 confirmed that Congress had recently found a continuing remedial need for the DBE program).

Over more than two decades, Congress has collected and considered extensive testimony, reports, statistical evidence, and social science data regarding the persistence of racial discrimination in public \b \i0 \ul0 [**34]\b0 \i0 \ul0   contracting. n23 The evidence established that, in addition to  \b \i0 \ul0 [*18]\b0 \i0 \ul0   outright discrimination by prime contractors and suppliers, racial discrimination in other aspects of the industry, including access to financial credit and other "economic inequities," 61 Fed.

In addition, state and local disparity studies "contain extensive statistical analyses . . . [that] revealed gross disparities between the availability of minority-owned businesses and the utilization of such businesses in state and local government procurement." Id. at 26,061. Based on the record, Congress determined that the disadvantages caused by racial discrimination continue to diminish federal contracting opportunities for minority-owned businesses.  Id. at 26,062. Moreover, Congress recognized that federal procurement practices effectively subsidize the discrimination of private and public actors, id. at 26,062-63, which is unsurprising given the government's dominance in \b \i0 \ul0 [**35]\b0 \i0 \ul0   the highway construction industry.

Despite the sparse legislative record and petitioner's insistence that Congress had not created a sufficient record to justify a raceconscious program, 448 U.S. at 520 n.4, the Court in Fullilove determined that "although the Act recites no  \b \i0 \ul0 [*19]\b0 \i0 \ul0   preambulary 'findings' on the subject, we are satisfied that Congress had abundant historical basis from which it could conclude that traditional procurement practices, when applied to minority businesses, could perpetuate the effects of prior discrimination."

Reg. at 26,059 & nn.101, 108 (citing evidence of exclusion). Moreover, in Fullilove, this Court upheld a program justified partly by evidence of "difficulties confronting minority businesses," including "deficiencies in working capital, inability to meet bonding requirements, disabilities caused by inadequate \b \i0 \ul0 [**38]\b0 \i0 \ul0   'track record,' lack of awareness of bidding opportunities, unfamiliarity with bidding procedures, preselection before the formal advertising process, and the exercise of discretion by government procurement officers to disfavor minority businesses," 448 U.S. at 467, all of which were facially race-neutral.

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Second, Petitioner incorrectly claims that Congress relied on statistics derived from an improper statistical pool because there was no evidence that minority contractors were available to do the work in question. (Pet. Br. at 29-30.) On the contrary, the studies on which Congress relied compared the "availability \b \i0 \ul0 [**39]\b0 \i0 \ul0   of minority-owned businesses and the utilization of such businesses in state and local government procurement." 61 Fed. Reg. at 26,061 (emphasis added). Moreover, when recipients develop their own DBE participation goals, the regulations require evidence of "the relative availability of DBEs in [the local] market." 49 C.F.R. \'a7 26.45(b) (emphasis added). That requirement comports with this Court's rulings. In Croson, for example, this Court stated that an inference of discriminatory exclusion may arise "where there is a significant statistical disparity between the number of qualified minority contractors willing and able to perform a particular service and the number of such contractors actually engaged by the [government] or [its] prime contractors." 488 U.S. at 509. It is precisely that  \b \i0 \ul0 [*21]\b0 \i0 \ul0   type of evidence on which Congress based the need to enact TEA-21.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0 D. Under Croson, the body of evidence necessary to justify congressional action is necessarily different from that required of state and local governments.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 While this Court has ruled that strict scrutiny applies to any governmental race classification, see \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Adarand,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  515 U.S. at 227, \b \i0 \ul0 [**40]\b0 \i0 \ul0   it emphasized that the range and scale of congressional acts are necessarily different from those of states and localities. Indeed, it has explicitly stated that Congress has a broader scope than its state and local counterparts with which to identify and address compelling national interests. n27 See Croson, 488 U.S. at 490.
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n27 For example, in Fullilove, this Court explicitly stated that "in no organ of government, state or federal, does there repose a more comprehensive remedial power than in the Congress." 448 U.S. at 483 (Burger, C.J.). While \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Adarand\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  overruled Fullilove insofar as it held that race-based programs by the federal government are subject to less than strict scrutiny, this Court has not questioned the distinctive authority of Congress. Rather, the Court rejected the claim made in Justice Stevens' dissent in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Adarand\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that "we have ignored the difference between federal and state legislatures," noting that the Court was not addressing the scope of Congress' power to deal with the problem of racial discrimination or the extent to which courts should defer to such congressional authority.  515 U.S. at 230.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Petitioner is wrong \b \i0 \ul0 [**41]\b0 \i0 \ul0   to suggest that, in order to satisfy strict scrutiny, the DBE program must meet the requirements to which the Court held the City of Richmond in Croson. That claim is repudiated by Croson itself. In distinguishing the Richmond City Council from the United States Congress, the Court in Croson emphasized that Congress "has a specific constitutional mandate to enforce the dictates of the Fourteenth Amendment," a mandate which also includes the "power to define situations which Congress determines  \b \i0 \ul0 [*22]\b0 \i0 \ul0   threaten principles of equality and to adopt prophylactic rules to deal with those situations." Id. (emphasis in original). Based on that mandate, the Court determined that "Congress may identify and redress the effects of society-wide discrimination," but that states and local governments did not have the same discretion. Id.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Congress is afforded considerable latitude in the manner in which it identifies and redresses racial discrimination through its power to enforce the Civil War Amendments. See \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Adarand,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  228 F.3d at 1163; Metro Broadcasting, 497 U.S. at 605 (O'Connor, J., dissenting) ("Congress has considerable latitude, presenting special concerns for \b \i0 \ul0 [**42]\b0 \i0 \ul0   judicial review, when it exercises its 'unique remedial powers . . . under \'a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment'"); Croson, 488 U.S. at 504; see also Garrett, 121 S. Ct. at 964-65; Kimel, 528 U.S. at 89. Indeed, the Croson Court recognized this principle when it said that "the degree of specificity required in the findings of discrimination and the breadth of discretion in the choice of remedies may vary with the nature and authority of the governmental body." 488 U.S. at 489 (quoting Fullilove, 448 U.S. at 515-16 n.14). That is, the evidentiary showing necessary for Congress to demonstrate a compelling interest must be evaluated in the context of its legislative jurisdiction and unique enforcement powers. Because Congress' legislative authority differs from that of states and localities, so does the nature of the evidence required for it to demonstrate a compelling interest. See id. at 491.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Congress is not an amalgam of city councils, and is not required to develop an evidentiary predicate with the kind of local precision required of individual municipalities. See Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U.S. 112, 133, 233 (1970) \b \i0 \ul0 [**43]\b0 \i0 \ul0   (upholding constitutionality of ban on literacy tests in national elections despite absence of state-by-state findings of discrimination); see also id. at 284 ("Congress was not required to make state-by-state findings" concerning the  \b \i0 \ul0 [*23]\b0 \i0 \ul0   discriminatory impact of literacy tests) (Stewart, J., with Burger, C.J., and Blackmun, J.). Although the scope of unlawful discrimination is undoubtedly relevant to the existence of a compelling interest to employ race-conscious remedies, see U.S. v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598, 626-27 (2000), this Court has never held that Congress' capability to adduce such evidence is limited to locating unconstitutional discrimination in some particular number of states or localities. See Boerne, 521 U.S. at 533 (recognizing that although geographic limitations may ensure that Section 5 legislation is proportionate to the scope of the harm, "this is not to say, of course, that \'a7 5 legislation requires . . . geographic restrictions"). And it similarly has never held that Congress must adduce city-by-city, region-by-region, or state-by-state evidence of unconstitutional discrimination before it may legitimately impose national remedies.  \b \i0 \ul0 [**44]\b0 \i0 \ul0   See \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Adarand,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  228 F.3d at 1165 n.10.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Indeed, to require findings of discrimination in some pre-specified number of states would not only infringe on the deference afforded Congress to determine the content of remedial legislation, see Boerne, 521 U.S. at 536; Kimel, 528 U.S. at 81, it would also inappropriately constrain the evidentiary processes through which Congress enacts such legislation. n28 A requirement of state-by-state findings before Congress could enact remedial legislation would effectively eliminate its enhanced role as a national legislature brought about by the Civil War Amendments, and virtually guarantee that Congress could never pass such legislation. See Rothe,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*24]\b0 \i0 \ul0   49 F. Supp. 2d at 949. Such a result would contradict this Court's admonition in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Adarand\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that strict judicial scrutiny not be "strict in theory, but fatal in fact." 515 U.S. at 237.
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n28 On this latter point, this Court has deferred to Congress' competence to select the specific fact-finding avenues through which it detects unconstitutional discrimination. See Boerne, 521 U.S. at 531-32 ("As a general matter, it is for Congress to determine the method by which it will reach a decision."); Fullilove, 448 U.S. at 499-502 (Powell, J., concurring) (noting that Congress is especially qualified to make findings of fact).
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  \b \i0 \ul0 [**45]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Petitioner mistakenly cites certain recent cases--including Boerne, Garrett, and Morrison--for the proposition that a compelling interest to remedy race discrimination is only justifiable in those states in which Congress has specifically found discrimination. (Pet. Br. at 33.) None of these cases provides support for Petitioner's position. Boerne, for example, does not provide that statespecific findings are required before national remedies may be imposed. Indeed, it specifically states that geographic restrictions are not required under Section 5. See Boerne, 521 U.S. at 533. The Court contrasted the evidence supporting laws motivated by religious bias with the evidence of racial discrimination supporting the provisions of the Voting Rights Act (VRA).  Id. at 532-33. It concluded that, as the Court defined the right to religious freedom under the First Amendment, Congress adduced insufficient evidence of governmental infringement on that right to justify the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. See id.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Similarly, in Garrett, the Court ruled that Congress did not adduce sufficient findings that a nationwide pattern of government discrimination supported \b \i0 \ul0 [**46]\b0 \i0 \ul0   the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) as a valid exercise of Section 5.  121 S. Ct. at 965. Although the Garrett Court contrasted the evidence before Congress in enacting the VRA as instructive of the comparative insufficiency of the ADA findings, id. at 967, it did not hold that Congress must make state-specific findings before imposing national remedies. Id.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In Morrison, the Court contrasted the provision of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) at issue in that case with certain VRA provisions.  529 U.S. at 626-27. In finding a portion of VAWA unconstitutional, the Court noted in dicta that VAWA's remedies applied nationally, while the VRA's remedies applied only in those states where Congress  \b \i0 \ul0 [*25]\b0 \i0 \ul0   found discrimination. See id. In acknowledging these differences, however, the Court did not overrule its prior holding that Congress only need identify a "nationwide pattern of discrimination" before enacting remedial legislation, see Kimel, 528 U.S. at 89, a point demonstrated by the Court's subsequent decision in Garrett, 121 S. Ct. at 965.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The record before Congress is sufficient to establish such a nationwide \b \i0 \ul0 [**47]\b0 \i0 \ul0   pattern of discrimination in the construction industry. Although there is no requirement of geographic-specific findings of discrimination to justify remedial legislation, the DBE program employs the consideration of local market conditions in the operation of the program. Under the regulations, recipients set their own minority participation goals based on the availability of minority contractors in the local market. 49 C.F.R. \'a7 26.45. To the extent that race-conscious measures are undertaken at all, they may be based on a variety of factors in the local market, including past utilization. Id. This requirement operates to tailor DBE participation goals to local needs and to limit the race-conscious measures of the program to those geographic regions where local market conditions indicate a need. For these reasons, Petitioner's reliance on Boerne, Garrett, and Morrison is misplaced.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 II. THE DBE PROGRAM IS NARROWLY TAILORED TO SATISFY CONGRESS' COMPELLING INTERESTS.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In remanding this case, this Court in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Adarand\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  identified two specific questions for the lower court to address in the narrow tailoring inquiry: (i) whether Congress considered race-neutral means to achieve its \b \i0 \ul0 [**48]\b0 \i0 \ul0   interests, 515 U.S. at 237-38; and (ii) whether the DBE program was appropriately limited to "not last longer than the discriminatory effects it is  \b \i0 \ul0 [*26]\b0 \i0 \ul0   designed to eliminate," n29 id. (quoting Fullilove, 448 U.S. at 513). With respect to these factors, the revised DBE program falls well within constitutional bounds. See \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Adarand,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  228 F.3d at 1176-87. Moreover, other factors, such as the program's individualized inquiry into disadvantage and its limited burdens on third parties, demonstrate that the program is narrowly tailored.
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n29 The Court identified these issues in connection with program-specific questions related to older versions of the relevant statutes and regulations, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Adarand,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  515 U.S. at 237-38, some of which are no longer in effect, see \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Adarand,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  228 F.3d at 1159.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Race-neutral Alternatives. The DBE program requires that participants employ race-conscious remedies only as a last resort. Specifically, applicable regulations mandate that participants "must meet the maximum feasible portion of [their] overall goal by using race-neutral means of facilitating DBE participation." 49 C.F.R. \'a7 26.51(a).  \b \i0 \ul0 [**49]\b0 \i0 \ul0   These raceneutral alternatives may include outreach efforts, the provision of technical assistance to small businesses, and the formation of lending and bonding programs to assist small businesses in obtaining financing. See 49 C.F.R. \'a7 26.51; see also \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Adarand,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  228 F.3d at 1178-79. By law, therefore, a recipient must use race-neutral alternatives to achieve as much of its minority participation goal as possible before adopting any race-conscious measures. 49 C.F.R. \'a7 26.51(d). If a recipient expects to be able to meet its entire overall goal through race-neutral means, it must implement its program without any use of race-conscious measures. Id. \'a7 26.51(f)(1). The DBE program, therefore, satisfies this part of the strict scrutiny test. See Croson, 488 U.S. at 507.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Durational Requirements. The DBE program is also appropriately limited to ensure that race-conscious measures last no longer than necessary to address the discriminatory effects Congress identified. First, the DBE program, along  \b \i0 \ul0 [*27]\b0 \i0 \ul0   with TEA-21, expires in 2004, unless Congress reauthorizes the program pursuant to a determination that its remedies remain necessary.  64 Fed. Reg. at 5103. \b \i0 \ul0 [**50]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Second, the regulations require a recipient to reevaluate its DBE participation goal annually. Based on this annual review, the recipient proposes its minority participation goal for the following year and must reduce or eliminate the use of raceconscious means to the extent they become unnecessary. 49 C.F.R. \'a7 26.51(f). Third, the duration of participation for any particular individual or firm is limited by the personal net worth threshold and business size requirements. When an individual's personal wealth exceeds $ 750,000, see id. \'a7 26.67, or the DBE's gross receipts are inconsistent with those of a small business, see id. \'a7 26.65, DBE program eligibility ends.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The durational limitations are bolstered by other aspects of the DBE program that ensure it is both flexible and limited in scope. The DBE program is strictly voluntary in that prime contractors are not denied opportunities to participate in federal procurement programs, and no contracts are withdrawn if a contractor fails to satisfy the participation goals. See id. \'a7 26.51; 64 Fed. Reg. at 5098. Moreover, the statute explicitly provides that the Secretary of Transportation may waive the participation goal \b \i0 \ul0 [**51]\b0 \i0 \ul0   for any reason, Pub. L. No. 105-178, \'a7 1101(b), and, under the DOT regulations, state and local recipients of DOT financial assistance may apply for waivers that will release them from almost any DOT regulation if they believe that they can achieve equal opportunity for DBEs through alternative approaches. 49 C.F.R. \'a7 26.15. Correspondingly, recipients can be exempted from any provision of the regulations if special circumstances make compliance impractical. See id. \'a7 26.15(a).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Individualized Inquiry. This Court has never held that a race-conscious remedy is constitutional only if it provides for an inquiry into the propriety of each beneficiary's receipt of  \b \i0 \ul0 [*28]\b0 \i0 \ul0   remedial aid. See \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Adarand,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  515 U.S. at 237-38; Croson, 488 U.S. at 507-08. Nevertheless, the current DBE program provides for an individualized inquiry into each and every person who seeks the DBE designation to ensure that the program is proportional to the harm it seeks to remedy and prevent. See Boerne, 521 U.S. at 533. As Petitioner acknowledges (Pet. Br. at 10 n.6), the program provides that every participating business--including "each presumptively disadvantaged" firm--must \b \i0 \ul0 [**52]\b0 \i0 \ul0   be certified as a disadvantaged business enterprise. 49 C.F.R. \'a7 26.67(a)(1). The certification process includes submission of a written, notarized certification of actual disadvantage and proof of personal worth, which is signed under penalty of perjury. Id. \'a7 26.67(a). Contrary to Petitioner's suggestion (Pet. Br. at 11), the presumption of disadvantage does not alone render a business enterprise automatically eligible for the program. First, although several racial and ethnic groups are considered presumptively disadvantaged, if a particular group is not represented among a local market's available contractors, it will not be included in the analysis of available firms the recipient uses to set its participation goals. 49 C.F.R. \'a7 26.45(b). Second, the government has crafted the implementing regulations to ensure that only disadvantaged persons participate. See Participation by Disadvantaged Business Enterprises in Dep't of Transporation Financial Assistance Programs, 66 Fed. Reg. 23,208, 23,210 (May 8, 2001) (to be codified at 49 C.F.R. pt. 26) (noting the importance of requiring proof of personal worth because "recipients must have a tool to ensure that non-disadvantaged \b \i0 \ul0 [**53]\b0 \i0 \ul0   persons do not participate in the program"). If the individual's worth exceeds the regulatory limit or if the individual is not in fact socially or economically disadvantaged, the presumption is rebutted. 49 C.F.R. \'a7 26.67(b). By including a rebuttable presumption in the statutory scheme, Congress recognized the possibility that the opportunities of particular minority individuals may not now be affected by discrimination and its accompanying  \b \i0 \ul0 [*29]\b0 \i0 \ul0   disadvantages, and also that members of other groups may have suffered comparable social and economic disadvantage. See Fullilove, 448 U.S. at 489.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Minimal Impact on Third Parties. The DBE program exacts a relatively small cost on firms that do not receive a presumption of disadvantage. As long as a prime contractor makes good faith efforts to satisfy the participation goal, it will never lose a contract for failure to comply.  64 Fed. Reg. at 5098. In addition, to avoid any undue burden on non-DBE firms, the revised regulations require recipients to guard against an overconcentration of DBEs in a certain type of work; if a recipient determines that "DBE firms are so overconcentrated in a certain type of \b \i0 \ul0 [**54]\b0 \i0 \ul0   work as to unduly burden the opportunity of non-DBE firms to participate in this type of work," it must devise strategies to address the overconcentration. 49 C.F.R. \'a7 26.33 (describing strategies recipient might invoke to ensure "that non-DBEs are not unfairly prevented from competing for subcontracts"). Moreover, a firm not owned by a woman or member of a racial minority group can itself qualify as socially disadvantaged by a mere preponderance of the evidence. n30 Id. \'a7 26.61(d). To the extent that any subcontractors are disadvantaged by their exclusion from the presumption of disadvantage, it is only incidental. Such a burden is permissible where the aim, as here, is to eradicate racial discrimination and its effects. See, e.g., Wygant, 476 U.S. at 280-81.
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n30 Under the old DOT regulations, non-minority applicants who sought DBE certification had to prove social disadvantage by clear and convincing evidence. See \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Adarand,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  228 F.3d at 1191.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In contrast, the detriment to minority businesses in the absence of the DBE program would be substantial. By all accounts, the participation of minority businesses in government procurement programs would "fall \b \i0 \ul0 [**55]\b0 \i0 \ul0   dramatically  \b \i0 \ul0 [*30]\b0 \i0 \ul0   in the absence of at least some kind of remedial measures." 61 Fed. Reg. at 26,053; see also id. at 26,062 & nn.130-34 (citing studies); \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Adarand,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  228 F.3d at 1174; 144 Cong. Rec. S1404 (daily ed. Mar. 5, 1998) (statement of Sen. Baucus) (citing experience of Michigan, where DBE participation in state highway program fell to zero in nine-month period after state terminated DBE program). n31 Considering the relative burden on affected parties and judged against the backdrop of this Court's equal protection jurisprudence, the DBE program is narrowly tailored to accommodate the government's legitimate remedial and preventive interests.
