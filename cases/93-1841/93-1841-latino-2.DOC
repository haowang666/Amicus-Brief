\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 INTERESTS:\b0 \i0 \ul0  The Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law (Lawyers' Committee) is a national civil rights organization formed in 1963 by leaders of the American bar at the request of President Kennedy, to provide legal representation to African-Americans who were being deprived of their civil rights.  The Lawyers' Committee and its local affiliates have represented the interests of African-Americans, Hispanics and women in hundreds of class actions relating to employment discrimination, voting rights, housing, equalization of municipal services and school desegregation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 INTEREST OF THE AMICI CURIAE
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is a nationwide, nonprofit, nonpartisan organization with nearly 300,000 members dedicated to the principles of liberty and equality embodied in the Constitution.  Since its founding in 1920, the ACLU has played an active role in the battle for racial justice and has long supported the constitutionality of affirmative action in appropriate circumstances.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Women's Legal Defense Fund (WLDF), founded in 1971, is a national advocacy organization that works to develop and promote policies to help women achieve equal opportunity, quality health care, and economic security for themselves and their families.  Over its 23-year history, WLDF has placed special emphasis on workplace discrimination issues, including sexual harassment, pay equity and affirmative action.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The National Women's Law Center (Center) is a nonprofit legal advocacy organization dedicated to the advancement and protection of women's rights and the corresponding elimination of sex discrimination from all facets of American life.  Since 1972, the Center has actively sought to remedy sex discrimination and secure the rights of women, and has participated in major Supreme Court cases addressing women's rights.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The National Council of La Raza (NCLR) is a private, nonprofit corporation dedicated to reducing poverty within, and discrimination against, the Hispanic community.  NCLR is the largest constituency-based national Hispanic organization, and serves all Hispanic nationality groups in all regions of the country.  NCLR represents nearly 200 formal affiliates -- local community-based Hispanic organizations -- who together serve more than two million Hispanics annually in 37 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. n1

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 STATEMENT OF FACTS
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In 1975, Congress found that pervasive discrimination had formed a barrier against the creation of minority-owned businesses and had decreased the opportunities available to those minority-owned businesses that had managed to overcome that barrier. n2 In response to those findings, Congress established for federal agencies a minimum goal of five percent participation by disadvantaged business enterprises ("DBEs") in federal contracting programs. n3 DBEs are defined by statute as economically \b \i0 \ul0 [*6]\b0 \i0 \ul0   and socially disadvantaged enterprises, and minority-owned businesses are presumed (subject to rebuttal) to be such enterprises. n4 Nonminorities may qualify for the DBE designation if they meet the criteria for social and economic disadvantage.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Federal Lands Highway Program ("FLHP"), an agency within the Department of Transportation, has implemented Congress' DBE mandate through a Subcontracting Compensation Clause ("SCC") that provides prime contractors additional compensation if they use a minimum percentage of DBEs as subcontractors.  The SCC program is one component of Congress' overall scheme to promote the economic integration of minorities into the mainstream economy. n5 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n5 The FLHP administered $ 55 million of the total $ 740 million Congress appropriated annually, from 1987 to 1991, for federal highway construction.  STURAA, 101 Stat. 138 \'a7 103(b)(4)(G), 145 \'a7 106(a) (8).
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 At issue here is a contract awarded by Central Federal Lands Highway Division ("CFLHD"), a regional division of FLHP responsible for highway construction on federal lands in several states.  CFLHD does not require that contractors bidding on prime contracts include DBEs in their bids, and it awards contracts to the lowest bidder irrespective of DBE participation.  However, contracts used by CFLHD contain the SCC, which provides that if the prime contractor voluntarily subcontracts ten percent or more to a DBE, the prime contractor \b \i0 \ul0 [*8]\b0 \i0 \ul0   receives additional compensation for locating, training, utilizing, assisting and developing that DBE. n6 The SCC program is intended to increase DBE subcontracting without imposing any mandatory goals or instituting any quotas.

\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 At issue in this case is Congress' power to address the effects of past and continuing discrimination that has hampered the participation of minority businesses in the economy.  The issue is not a new one.  In Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U.S. 448 (1980), this Court upheld a race-conscious program enacted by Congress to remedy the effects of racial and ethnic discrimination.  Subsequent decisions of this Court, and of every federal appellate court before which the question has been raised, have confirmed that Congress has the power -- beyond that of states and other governing bodies -- to address, through such programs, the problems caused \b \i0 \ul0 [*9]\b0 \i0 \ul0   by past and continuing discrimination.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 These decisions properly recognize the unique power granted to Congress by the Reconstruction Amendments.  Thus, they apply to race-conscious programs established by Congress in response to discrimination a standard of review that differs from the strict scrutiny applicable to state and local programs.  This standard requires the Court to examine carefully such programs and balance the protections of the Fifth Amendment with deference to Congress' enforcement powers under the Reconstruction Amendments.  The workable standard articulated by the Fullilove majority can and should be applied to uphold the program here at issue.
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 ARGUMENT
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 I.  THIS COURT HAS CONSISTENTLY AND CORRECTLY RECOGNIZED THAT THE CONSTITUTION GRANTS CONGRESS UNIQUE AUTHORITY TO ENACT RACE-CONSCIOUS PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS THE EFFECTS OF DISCRIMINATION
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The economic integration of members of minority groups who have suffered pervasive discrimination in our society continues to be one of the most important and difficult problems our nation must confront. n7 The fundamental issue raised by petitioner -- does Congress have authority to use programs that rely on, among other \b \i0 \ul0 [*10]\b0 \i0 \ul0   factors, race or ethnicity, in order to ameliorate the dislocation and exclusion from the economic mainstream caused by racial or ethnic discrimination -- has already been addressed and resolved by this Court.  In Fullilove, and subsequent cases, this Court has consistently recognized that the Enforcement Clauses of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the Constitution enable Congress to establish such programs. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n7 "The fact is that racism and prejudice are alive and well in America and have caused us to scale higher heights and labor with greater burdens than that of our fellow majority contractors."

Cruz III).
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 A.  Fullilove and Its Progeny Have Upheld the Authority of Congress to Enact Race-Conscious Programs and Have Distinguished Congress' Power From That of the States
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360  Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U.S. 448 (1980), is this Court's seminal decision addressing Congress' authority to promote the economic rights of minorities affected by this \b \i0 \ul0 [*11]\b0 \i0 \ul0   nation's legacy of discrimination.  The Court there upheld congressional authority to make "limited use of racial and ethnic criteria," id. at 473, to respond to the effects of past and continuing racial and ethnic discrimination. n8 At issue in Fullilove was the Public Works Employment Act of 1977 ("PWEA"), which included a requirement that states accepting federal construction funds allocate at least ten percent of such funds for contracts awarded to businesses owned by minorities.  Every member of the Court recognized that Congress had broad and unique powers to combat racial discrimination; n9 a clear majority of the Court thought Congress' power was sufficient to uphold the set-aside program at issue in that case. n10 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n8 In addition to finding that racial criteria were acceptable for remedial purposes, the plurality opinion of Chief Justice Burger, joined by Justices White and Powell, also noted that the use of such criteria, if properly limited, was permissible "to effectuate the constitutional mandate for equality of economic opportunity." Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U.S. 448, 489 (1980). See also id. at 463, 490.
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n9 See id. at 472-73 (opinion of Burger, C.J., joined by White and Powell, JJ.); id. at 520 n.4 (opinion of Marshall, J., joined by Brennan and Blackmun, JJ.); id. at 526 (opinion of Stewart, J., joined by Rehnquist, J.); id. at 548 (opinion of Stevens, J.).
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n10 In addition, Justice Stevens, in dissent, distinguished the Fullilove program from one, like the program at issue here, in which "[r]ace was used as no more than a factor in identifying the class of the disadvantaged." Id. at 535 n.6 (Stevens, J., dissenting).
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  \b \i0 \ul0 [*12]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Chief Justice Burger distinguished Congress' power from that of state and local governments in sweeping terms: "It is fundamental that in no organ of government, state or federal, does there repose a more comprehensive remedial power than in the Congress, expressly charged by the Constitution with competence and authority to enforce equal protection guarantees." Id. at 483. n11 Similarly, Justice Powell pointed out:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 When we first confronted [the] issue [of affirmative action] in Bakke, I concluded that the Regents of the University of California were not competent to make . . . findings sufficient to uphold the use of the race-conscious remedy they adopted. . . .  But the issue here turns on the scope of congressional power, and Congress has been given a unique constitutional role in the enforcement of the post-Civil War Amendments. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n11 Chief Justice Burger observed that Congress' authority to enact the program at issue was rooted as well in the Spending and Commerce Clauses.  U.S. Const., Art. I, \'a7 8, cl. 1 & 3.  Congress may employ the spending power to further these policy objectives, and, where "inequity has an effect on interstate commerce," Congress can, through the Commerce Clause, take "necessary and proper action to remedy the situation." Fullilove, 448 U.S. at 475. In addition, when using its spending power, "Congress may attach conditions on the receipt of federal funds, and has repeatedly employed the power 'to further broad policy objectives by conditioning receipt of federal moneys upon compliance with federal statutory and administrative directives.'" South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 206 (1987) (quoting Fullilove, 448 U.S. at 474).

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  Id. at 516 (Powell, J., concurring) (emphasis added). n12
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n12 See also Fullilove, 448 U.S. at 499 (Powell, J., concurring) ("Unlike the Regents of the University of California, Congress properly may -- and indeed must -- address directly the problems of discrimination in our society."); Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497 U.S. 547, 608-09 (1990) ("Bakke [was] a case that did not involve congressional action") (O'Connor, J., dissenting).
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Nearly a decade after Fullilove, in Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469 (1989), the Court forcefully reaffirmed the Fullilove decision and its rationale. n13 In Croson, the Court struck down a minority set-aside plan instituted by the City of Richmond.  But in so doing, the Court went to great lengths to distinguish the "unique powers" of Congress from the more circumscribed authority of states and municipalities: "Congress, unlike any State or political subdivision, has a specific constitutional mandate" allowing it to "identify and redress the effects of society-wide discrimination." Croson, 488 U.S. at 490. See generally id. at 486-93. The logic of \b \i0 \ul0 [*14]\b0 \i0 \ul0   such a distinction, according to the Court's opinion, could be found in "[t]he Civil War Amendments themselves[, which] worked a dramatic change in the balance between congressional and state power over matters of race." Id. at 490. n14 Justice Scalia, concurring, further articulated the rationale for treating congressional action differently: "A sound distinction between federal and state (or local) action based on race rests not only upon the substance of the Civil War Amendments, but upon social reality and governmental theory." Id. at 522 (Scalia, J., concurring).  Thus, in Croson, this Court again differentiated the broad power of Congress to consider race in enacting programs to ameliorate the effects of past and continuing discrimination from the more limited power of states and other political entities to do so. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n13 See Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 490-91 (1989) (opinion of O'Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist, C.J. and White, J.); id. at 521-22 (opinion of Scalia, J.); id. at 557-58 (opinion of Marshall, J., joined by Brennan and Blackmun, JJ.).

("Congress may authorize, pursuant to section 5, state action that would be foreclosed to the states acting alone") (citation omitted); id. ("[T]he Civil War Amendments granted 'additional powers to the Federal government.'" (citation omitted).
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  \b \i0 \ul0 [*15]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Court embraced this distinction once again in Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497 U.S. 547 (1990). Metro Broadcasting involved a challenge to policies used by the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") in awarding radio and television broadcast licenses that relied, in part, on race.  The Court upheld the programs, attributing "overriding significance . . . [to the fact] that the FCC's minority ownership policies ha[d] been specifically approved -- indeed, mandated -- by Congress." Id. at 563. n15 The Court expressly noted that "much of the language and reasoning in Croson reaffirmed the lesson of Fullilove that race-conscious classifications adopted by Congress to address racial and ethnic discrimination are subject to a different standard than such classifications prescribed by state and local governments." Id. at 565. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n15 The principal dissent in Metro Broadcasting raised the question whether the federal government could rely on its authority under \'a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to justify actions that did not directly implicate the states.  497 U.S. at 606-07 (O'Connor, J., dissenting).  While this Court has never so restricted the Enforcement Clauses of the Reconstruction Amendments, see Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 174 (1989) (noting with approval that "[i]n recent decades state and federal legislation has been enacted to prohibit private racial discrimination in many aspects of our society"); Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U.S. 409, 439 (1968) (noting that "the Enabling Clause of [the Thirteenth] Amendment empowered Congress to . . . 'pass all laws necessary and proper for abolishing all badges and incidents of slavery in the United States'" including laws prohibiting private discrimination) (quoting Civil Rights Cases, 109 U.S. 3, 20 (1883)); United States v. Guest, 383 U.S. 745, 762 (1966) ("\'a7 5 empowers the Congress to enact laws punishing all conspiracies -- with or without state action -- that interfere with Fourteenth Amendment rights") (Clark, J., concurring), the program at issue here does not raise the concerns articulated by the dissent for at least two reasons.
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 First, the broadcast licensing policies at issue in Metro Broadcasting involved an activity created and exclusively conducted by the federal government for non-remedial purposes.  In contrast, the highway construction program challenged here is one that intimately involves the states and does seek to ameliorate the conditions caused by past and continuing acts of discrimination.  Indeed, states are directly involved by virtue of their authority to certify DBEs.  In addition, highways built by the federal government on federal lands are integrally connected with highways built by the states utilizing federal funds.  Since Congress' right to attach conditions to the states' acceptance of such funds has been repeatedly affirmed (see Fullilove and cases collected infra at note 16), to prohibit Congress from putting similar conditions on money ear-marked for highway projects on federal lands would artificially hamstring Congress' ability to pursue the legitimate goal of the integration of all races into the economy.
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Second, as in Fullilove, the validity of the program challenged here should not be determined solely with reference to Congress' \'a7 5 powers.  Rather, in enacting the instant program -- as in Fullilove -- "Congress employed an amalgam of its specifically delegated powers," 448 U.S. at 473, including its power to act directly pursuant to the Spending and Commerce clauses.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  \b \i0 \ul0 [*16]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Taken together, Fullilove, Croson and Metro Broadcasting firmly establish the Court's view that Congress has the authority -- beyond that of other political entities -- to make limited use of racial criteria when fashioning programs to redress the effects of discrimination.  The clarity of the Court's position on the question of congressional authority (as expressed in these cases) is evidenced by the uniformity of subsequent appellate decisions. n16 As Judge Posner explained in one of those cases, Milwaukee County Pavers Association v. Fiedler, 922 F.2d 419 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 500 U.S. 954 (1991): "The joint lesson of [Fullilove and Croson] is that the federal government can, by virtue of the enforcement clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, engage in affirmative action with a freer hand than states and municipalities can do." Id. at 423-24. n17 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n16 See Harrison & Burrowes Bridge Constructors, Inc. v. Cuomo, 981 F.2d 50, 56 (2d Cir. 1992) ("The critical distinction between Croson and the [plaintiffs'] complaints regarding the federal program is that Croson concerned a non-federal program."); Ellis v.

\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n17 The lower courts' reliance on the clear path marked by Fullilove and Croson (and reconfirmed in Metro Broadcasting) mirrors the reliance that thousands of established and nascent subcontractors have placed on the continuing opportunities the challenged program provides.  See GAO Report to Congressional Requesters, "Highway Contracting" (Sept. 1992) ("Since 1988, state agencies have received thousands of new applications for participation in the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program for federal highways each year.").  As this Court has noted, the classic case for weighing reliance heavily in favor of following an earlier rule occurs in the commercial context.  See, e.g., Payne v.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Fullilove and its progeny correctly recognize that race-conscious programs enacted by Congress must be viewed "against the background of ongoing efforts directed toward deliverance of the century-old promise of equality of economic opportunity." Fullilove, 448 U.S. at 463. That promise is contained in the Reconstruction Amendments to the Constitution, n18 whose core principle is the protection of the civil, political and economic rights of minority group members affected by past and present discrimination.  The Amendments fundamentally altered the roles of the federal government and the states in guaranteeing this protection by giving to Congress new powers to define and enforce these Amendments, n19 while at the same time withdrawing those powers from the states.

Fullilove, 448 U.S. at 502 (Powell, J., concurring).

By selecting Congress as the appropriate repository of the power to enforce the Amendments, the framers embraced the Madisonian theory that the national legislature avoids the parochial interests and factionalism that permeate smaller \b \i0 \ul0 [*19]\b0 \i0 \ul0   governmental bodies. n21 As Justice O'Connor stated in Croson: the framers refused to "cede control over the content of the Equal Protection Clause to the 50 state legislatures and their myriad political subdivisions."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Although the Reconstruction Amendments transformed Congress' power to employ \b \i0 \ul0 [*22]\b0 \i0 \ul0   programs that rely on racial or ethnic distinctions to achieve economic integration, this Court has properly recognized that such power is not boundless.  For even though the Amendments granted Congress broad enforcement power, the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of Equal Protection, as incorporated in the Fifth Amendment, requires that such programs undergo examination to ensure that they do "not conflict with constitutional guarantees." Fullilove, 448 U.S. at 491.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This examination is not, as petitioner suggests, the sort of scrutiny employed by this Court in Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497 (1954). See Petitioner's Brief at 25.  Bolling, a companion case to Brown v. Board of Education, involved a challenge to the District of Columbia's segregated school system.  In imposing racial segregation on schools in the nation's capital, Congress was acting pursuant to its power contained in Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution, to pass legislation for the District.  See Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 545 (1896). There was no claim -- nor could there have been -- that segregation was intended to advance or protect the civil, political or economic \b \i0 \ul0 [*23]\b0 \i0 \ul0   rights or interests of minority group members.  This was not action taken by Congress pursuant to the power conferred upon it by the Reconstruction Amendments.  Thus, the racial classifications there were invidious and properly "scrutinized with particular care." Bolling, 347 U.S. at 499.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 That same level of scrutiny is not appropriate here.  To the contrary, what the Enforcement Clauses suggest, as the Court recognized in Fullilove, is that Congress is entitled to greater latitude and deference when it adopts, as an element of larger economic legislation, curative programs designed to redress the effects of past and continuing discrimination and promote the goals of the Reconstruction Amendments.  Fullilove, 448 U.S. at 462. While the Fullilove standard defies easy labelling, n32 it requires the Court to "inquire whether the objectives of the legislation are within the power of Congress" and then decide whether the legislation is an appropriate "means for achieving the congressional objectives." Id. at 473 (emphasis in original). 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n32 Petitioner tries to circumscribe Fullilove's reach as precedent by squeezing the standard articulated by the plurality into the label "strict scrutiny." Petitioner's Brief at 26-27.  What petitioner ignores, however, is that regardless of the varying terminologies, the majority found Congress' use of a remedial set-aside program constitutional.  Therefore, it is far more productive to glean the fundamental principles applied by the plurality than to try to characterize the standard.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The program at issue in this case, the SCC program, is a product of the same broad congressional action that the Court considered, and upheld, in Fullilove. n33 The SCC program provides compensation to prime contractors who voluntarily elect to subcontract a minimum percentage of their highway construction projects to disadvantaged businesses.  The program accepts DBEs certified under several sets of regulations implementing the Small Business Act ("SBA") and the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act ("STURAA").  STURAA was modeled on the PWEA, which was at issue in Fullilove, and the PWEA, in turn, was modeled on the SBA. n34

However, Congress is not required to make adjudicatory findings of actual discrimination before enacting remedial legislation.  Fullilove, 448 U.S. at 502-03 (Powell, J., concurring).  "Congress is not an adjudicatory body called upon to resolve specific disputes between competing adversaries.  The creation of national rules for the governance of our society simply does not entail the same concept of recordmaking that is appropriate to a judicial or administrative proceeding." Id. at 502; see also Croson, 488 U.S. at 489 (Congress "need not make specific findings of discrimination to engage in race-conscious relief") (opinion of O'Connor, J.).  Requiring Congress to make such specific factual findings "would mark an unprecedented imposition of adjudicatory procedures upon a coordinate branch of Government.  Neither the Constitution nor our democratic tradition warrants such a constraint on the legislative process." Fullilove, 448 U.S. at 503 (Powell, J., concurring).

In the 1978 amendments to the SBA, Congress based its efforts to promote equality of economic opportunity on a lengthy evidentiary record of persistent and widespread discrimination against minority businesses. n38 These amendments were premised on findings that such legislation was necessary to remedy the effects of discrimination on the ability of minority businesses to keep "pace with the growth of the national minority population." n39 Congress found that "many individuals are socially and economically disadvantaged as a result of being identified as members of certain [minority] groups." n40

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Congress' obligation to construct a narrowly-tailored program requires certain "critical determinations" to guide implementation and administration of the program.  Id. at 468. The plurality in Fullilove characterized those critical determinations as: "the decision to initiate a limited racial and ethnic preference; the specification of a minimum level for minority business participation; the identification of the minority group members that are to be encompassed by the program; and the provision for an administrative waiver where application of the program is not feasible." Id. Congress has made these determinations with regard to the program at issue here.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The challenged program reflects Congress' decisions to initiate a limited and rebuttable consideration of race and ethnicity and to identify the minorities encompassed by the program. n47 In making these decisions, Congress fashioned the rebuttable presumption to be flexible, and thereby neither overinclusive nor underinclusive. n48 Under the implementing regulations for STURAA, nonminorities may qualify as DBEs by demonstrating that they have suffered from social and economic disadvantage. n49 In addition, these \b \i0 \ul0 [*30]\b0 \i0 \ul0   regulations establish a mechanism to revoke a DBE's certification if it is found no longer to qualify as disadvantaged. n50 Because this mechanism allows the presumption to be rebutted, it functions as a waiver of the presumption in cases where its application would be unreasonable.  This procedure, an integral part of the program that Congress has reviewed on a regular basis, is designed to ensure that only disadvantaged minorities will benefit from the presumption.

\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Congress' selection of varied minority group members to benefit from the presumption is a valid exercise of its enforcement powers under the Reconstruction Amendments.  Although Congress initially exercised its enforcement powers primarily for the benefit of African-Americans, the Amendments and their Enforcement Clauses contain a general grant of authority to aid all minorities.  This Court has noted that although the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments were "addressed to the grievances of the negro race, and were designed to remedy them . . . '[w]e do not say that no one else but the negro can share in this protection.  Both the language and spirit of these Articles are to have their fair and just weight in any question of construction . . . [and] that protection will apply, though the party interested may not be of African descent.'" United States v.

\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n48 In this respect, the rebuttable presumption that is one feature of this program is comparable to the 1968 program developed by the Small Business Administration which Justice Stevens cited with approval in Fullilove.  See Fullilove, 448 U.S. at 535 n.6 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  In the 1968 program, like the program here at issue, "the class of socially or economically disadvantaged persons neither included all persons in the racial class nor excluded all non-members of the racial class.

In the SBA, Congress set a minimum goal for federal agencies of five percent for the use of DBEs in federal procurement, and required federal agencies to seek the "maximum practicable opportunity" for DBE participation in their procurement contracting. n51 Under STURAA, Congress set a minimum goal of ten percent for DBE participation in Department of Transportation procurement contracting. n52 Through the SBA and STURAA, Congress set thresholds to guide agencies in the implementation of federal contracting programs.  At the same time, Congress has allowed agencies to retain flexibility in setting reasonable goals for their individual agencies. n53

\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n53 Agencies are appropriate entities to carry out legislative directives under congressional supervision.  Indeed, this Court has recognized that agencies administering a program pursuant to a federal act should be given great deference in their interpretation of that act.  Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 843-44 (1984). "'The power of an administrative agency to administer a congressionally created . . . program necessarily requires the formulation of policy and the making of rules to fill any gap left, implicitly or explicitly, by Congress.'" Id. at 843 (quoting Morton v. Ruiz, 415 U.S. 199, 231 (1974) (ellipsis in original)).  In such a case, the agency acts as an agent of Congress.  Cf.  Milwaukee County Pavers Ass'n, 922 F.2d at 424 (state administering federal program acting as agent of federal government "is no more subject to being enjoined on equal protection grounds than the federal civil servants who drafted the regulations.").

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In addition to setting minimum goals for utilization of DBEs, Congress gave federal agencies a specific mandate to use incentives to increase DBE participation in federal contracting:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Agencies have the authority to include incentive clauses in government contracts to reward significant efforts on the part of the prime contractor to meet and exceed subcontracting goals.  According to the information available to the Committee, however, such clauses are used rarely by most agencies, or not at all.  This fact is further evidence that attempts to increase subcontracting goals for small and small disadvantaged business participation are feeble at best. n54

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Congress also endorsed incentive measures to increase DBE subcontracting under the \'a7 8(d) program of the SBA. n55 To that end, Congress has stated:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 [E]very Federal agency, in order to encourage subcontracting opportunities for small business concerns and small business concerns owned and controlled by the socially and economically disadvantaged individuals . . . is hereby authorized to provide such incentives as \b \i0 \ul0 [*33]\b0 \i0 \ul0   such Federal agency may deem appropriate in order to encourage such subcontracting opportunities as may be commensurate with the efficient and economical performance of the contract. n56

\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n55 Congress noted that in 1986, out of $ 61.9 billion subcontracted out by government prime contractors subject to \'a7 8(d), only 1.6% was subcontracted to DBEs.  Congress found "that these percentages do not reflect maximum practicable participation nor do they constitute an acceptable level of achievement." H.R. Rep. No. 460 at 37.

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The challenged program was developed by a division of the Department of Transportation in direct response to Congress' mandate for DBE participation under the SBA. n57 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n57 The Department of Transportation establishes annual goals in consultation with the Small Business Administration.  15 U.S.C. \'a7 644(g)(2).  The Department apportions part of its goal to the Federal Highway Administration, who then apportions part of its goal to the FLHP.  FLHP apportions this goal between its three regional offices; CFLHD, Eastern Federal Lands Highway Division, and Western Federal Lands Highway Division.
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Petitioner misunderstands this structure, arguing that because Congress set the level for small disadvantaged business participation at 5%, 15 U.S.C. \'a7 644(g)(1), CFLHD cannot set a goal of 12-15%.  Petitioner's Brief at 47 n.41.  CFLHD's target of 12-15% represents its efforts to meet its apportioned goal of FLHP's overall goal.  Moreover, under STURAA, Congress set a minimum goal of 10% for DBE participation in federal highway contracting.  In any case, CFLHD's goals are inapplicable to this case.  Petitioner challenges only the SCC program, in which agency goals are irrelevant -- if no prime contractor sought to take advantage of the SCC program, there would be no consequence.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Congress has repeatedly reviewed and approved programs implemented pursuant to its directive in the SBA. n58 Indeed, Congress maintains substantial oversight over the administration of minority and small disadvantaged business assistance programs. n59 The continual communication between Congress and federal agencies acting under the SBA ensures that the administration of this federal program complies with congressional objectives. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n58 The SBA requires agencies to be accountable to Congress for programs implemented under the SBA.  For instance, the SBA requires the Small Business Administration to report to the Committee on Small Business of the Senate and the Committee on Small Business of the House of Representatives on the extent of achievement by agencies (relative to their established goals) in federal contracting programs.  15 U.S.C. \'a7 644(h).  To that end, agencies are required to submit their fiscal year accomplishments annually.  Section 8(d)(11) of the SBA also requires each year a report of subcontracting plans approved by federal agencies but disapproved by the Small Business Administration for failure to provide maximum practicable opportunities for DBEs.  15 U.S.C. \'a7 637(d)(11).
