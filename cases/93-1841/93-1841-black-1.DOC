\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Congress, through the Small Business Act, requires the Executive Branch to use its purchasing power to foster the development of small businesses, including small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged persons.  See generally 15 U.S.C. \'a7 631 (Declaration of Policy)(the "Act").  The Act requires annual, government-wide \b \i0 \ul0 [*6]\b0 \i0 \ul0   goals to be set for purchases of supplies and services from small business enterprises and small disadvantaged business enterprises (DBEs), and sets a floor for the DBE procurement goal.  The statutory definition of DBE includes, but is not limited to a racial component.  Not exclusively race-based, the eligibility standards includes persons who have been subjected to "ethnic prejudice or cultural bias."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Amici argue that Congress has broad powers to enact such legislation and to delegate authority to the Executive Branch to implement its will; and that in delegating such authority, the Act is unambiguous about its intent to create constitutionally permissible "goals and opportunities" for small business enterprises and socially and economically disadvantaged business enterprises.  Amici argue that the use of a remedial expedient, the Subcontracting Compensation Clause ("SCC"), by Respondent to achieve the purposes of the Small Business Act, as amended, and supplemented by essential appropriation acts and procurement policies, comport with the will of Congress and do not violate the nondelegation rule.  All government actions were within the scope of its authority, and lawful.  \b \i0 \ul0 [*7]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Further, Amici argue that the SCC, a mere remedial expedient inviting a private act for a valuable government privilege, does not compel any private act for the valuable government privilege.  We emphasize that under the SCC, no government action is unbound, no governmental obligation vests, no liability of the government or prime contractor is created until the prime contractor is selected and thereafter exercises its sole discretion to accept the invitation of offer set forth by the terms of the SCC.  Amici submit that the selection of the DBE by Mountain Gravel & Construction Company in the exercise of its discretion under the SCC, objected to by Petitioner was a private act, not a cognizable action for the valuable government privilege under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Alternatively, Amici argue that the remedial expedient, SCC, as narrowly tailored by its own terms and the policies of the Executive Branch is as permissible as the set-aside program upheld by the Court in Fullilove v. Klutznick, n1 and its progeny. n2 We submit that the proper scope of judicial review adopted in Fullilove is the controlling precedent in this case,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*8]\b0 \i0 \ul0   if the constitutional guarantee claimed by Petitioner is a cognizable state action. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n1 488 U.S. 448 (1980).
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n2 See, e.g., Metro Broadcasting v. FCC, 497 U.S. 547 (1990).
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The SCC is just what it explains itself to be: a clause of a federal procurement contract which invites offers, subject to acceptance, n3 for monetary compensation "for awarding subcontracts to small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals." n4 The invitation for offer is made as part of the procurement process which lets contracts under a bidding procedure established by the Federal Acquisition Regulation System ("FAR"), n5 and implements the acquisition-related section of various congressional statutes, including the Small Business Act. n6 Drawing on the opinion of the court below, on September 15, 1989, a division of the Department of Transportation Central Federal Lands Highway Division ("CFLHD"), awarded a $ 1-million-plus prime contract to a small business contractor (Mountain Gravel & Construction Company), for a federal highway project in Colorado known as the West Dolores project. n7 Amici understand that Mountain Gravel \b \i0 \ul0 [*9]\b0 \i0 \ul0   was bound to fulfill the mandatory terms of the contract which had been awarded to it.  However, the SCC remained in a state of equipoise, as a continuing contractual incentive, which, according to its terms would either vest, or be rejected solely within the sole discretion of Mountain Gravel.  Hence, acceptance of the terms of the continuing offer incentive was voluntary and premised on a condition precedent: compensation could be awarded to Mountain Gravel, on condition that it accept the invitation to offer by awarding a relevant subcontract to small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, n8 denominated as DBE. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n3 RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS, \'a7 24, defines an offer as "a manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain so made as to justify another person in understanding that his assent to that bargain is invited and will conclude it." An invitation to offer in government contracts need not be accepted, but the power of acceptance permits the offeree to transform the offer into a contractual obligation.  See ARTHUR L. CORBIN, Offer and Acceptance and Some of The Resulting Legal Relations, 26 Yale L.J. 169, 181-182, 199-200 (1917).

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The bidding process went forward to subcontract for the guardrail systems.  Petitioner and a certified DBE n9 responded to the government's invitation to offer.  Mountain Gravel, acting on the continuing offer under the SCC, awarded the subcontract to the DBE.  Petitioner is before the Court claiming that the above described optional incentive program (SCC) is constitutionally impermissible because it violates the Equal Protection clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. n10

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 I.  THE SCC AND DBE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS COMPORT WITH THE SMALL BUSINESS ACT AND, AS IMPLEMENTED, VIOLATE NEITHER THE NONDELEGATION RULE, NOR IS BEYOND THE SCOPE OF AUTHORITY RULE AND IS OTHERWISE CONSTITUTIONALLY PERMISSIBLE
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The judicial principle undergirding the nondelegation rule permits Congress to delegate,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*11]\b0 \i0 \ul0   by statute, or amendment, the authority to implement the will of Congress.  The nondelegation rule n11 is an old rule and an important one because the people depend on this rule to assure that Congress does its work.  Hence, when Congress delegates its authority to a legislative agency, n12 a judicial unit, n13 or to an arm of the Executive Branch, n14 the text of the organic or amending act is required to establish general policy or standards to guide the delegate in the creation of tools to fill in the blanks to enable the delegate to fulfill the will of Congress in an efficient and effective manner, as an administrative function. n15

The delegation process and the incidental funding process is a means by which Congress reinforces its responsibilities incident to representation, n17 one that the Court has by tradition given deference, and shunned countermajoritarian intervention. n18

Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat) 316 (1819), stating, "The people of all the States have created the general government and have conferred upon it the general power of taxation.  The people of all the States, and the States themselves, are represented in Congress, and, by their representatives, exercise this power." Id. at 435.  Amici's search of the record does not show the absence of support for the Small Business Act programs enacted in 1978 or 1988 by any member of the Senate or House representatives from the State of Colorado.  However, even if there had been, it would not have undermined the reinforcement of the will of Congress to enact such a law.
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n18 Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984)(an agency's pronouncements will be given great deference, even, and particularly when the underlying statute is ambiguous).
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  \b \i0 \ul0 [*13]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In this case, Petitioner seeks the reversal of a decision which rejected Petitioner's claim that the terms of Section 502 of the Small Business Act of 1988, do not authorize the implementation of a remedial expedient contractual clause used by the Department of Transportation ("DOT") to carry out the will of Congress to provide potential opportunities for DBEs to minimally share in the wealth of their nation.  Petitioner makes this argument because his company was not selected as a subcontractor under the instant contract which contained a clause providing for a non-mandatory incentive allowing the prime contractor to select a disadvantaged business enterprise ("DBE") to build a guardrail at the West Dolores Project in the State of Colorado.  The prime contractor is White and the DBE is one of the following socially and economically disadvantaged Americans: Black American, Hispanic American, Asian-Pacific American or Subcontinent-Asian American.  15 U.S.C. \'a7 637 (d)(3)(C). n19 But, under the SCC and the scheme under attack in this case, the prime contractor could have selected a White DBE, if it qualified as being socially and economically disadvantaged.   \b \i0 \ul0 [*14]\b0 \i0 \ul0   15 U.S.C. \'a7 637 (a) et seq. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n19 As pointed out by the court below:
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 STURAA, and previously STAA, define "socially and economically disadvantaged individuals" with reference to the Small Business Act.  15 U.S.C. \'a7 637(d).  Under the Small Business Act, a small business must be at least 51% owned and controlled by individuals who are socially and economically disadvantaged.  Id. Members of certain minority racial and ethnic groups and women are presumed socially and economically disadvantaged.  Id. That presumption is rebuttable under the DBE criteria incorporated into CFLHD's SCC program.  Both minority-owned (DBEs) and women-owned small business enterprises (WBEs) may be decertified if it can be established that they are not socially and economically disadvantaged.  Non-minority-owned small businesses also are eligible for DBE certification by the Small Business Administration, provided that they satisfy the same eligibility minority-owned small business.
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 See 15 U.S.C. \'a7 637(a)(citing Surface Transportation Uniform Relocation Assistance Act, Pub. L. No. 100-17, 101 Stat. 144 \'a7 106(c) (1987); Surface Transportation Assistance Act, Pub. L. No. 97-424, 96 Stat. 2100 \'a7 105(f)); see also Adarand, 16 F.3d at 1541 (internal footnote omitted).

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Section 502 of the Small Business Act, Pub. L. No. 100-656, 102 Stat. 3881 (codified as amended in 15 U.S.C. \'a7 644(g)) states:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The President shall annually establish Government-wide goals for procurement contracts awarded to small business concerns and small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.  The Government-wide goal for participation by small business concerns shall be established at not less than 20 percent of the total value of all prime contract awards for each fiscal year.  The Government-wide goal for participation by small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals shall be established at not less than 5 percent of the total value of all prime contract and subcontract awards for each fiscal year.  Notwithstanding the Government-wide goal, each agency shall have an annual goal that presents, for that agency, the maximum practicable opportunity for small business concerns and small business and economically disadvantaged individuals to participate in the performance of contracts let by such agency.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Section 502, as required under the delegation \b \i0 \ul0 [*16]\b0 \i0 \ul0   rule, contains goals to be established by the agency delegates.  Textually, it mandates the establishment of government-wide goals at not less than 20% for small businesses and not less than 5% for disadvantaged businesses.  Although a government-wide goal is accentuated, the text clearly and plainly guides the agency delegate toward annually discretionary goals that reflect the "maximum practicable opportunity" for DBEs to participate in the federal procurement contracting process. n20 The text of 502 establishes the President's authority and the criterion to govern the President's course.  Section 502 directs: "The Administration and the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy shall, when exercising their authority pursuant to paragraph (2), insure that the cumulative annual prime contract goals for all agencies meet or exceed annual Government-wide prime contract goal established by the President pursuant to this paragraph." n21 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n20 No sanctions exist in law against any government agency if the goal and opportunity provision of Section 502 is not reached.  All that is required is an explanation to Congress justifying the shortfall, if any, of the goal.  Adarand, 16 F.3d at 1541 (citing 15 U.S.C. \'a7 644(h)).  However, the reporting provision is important because it demonstrates Congress's continuous concern and need to know the reason why the goal and opportunity provision of Section 502 is not being met.  In is in such reports that a department, such as DOT, could report to Congress that prime contractors are not responding to the government's invitations under the SCC.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The language of the Act is embracing, but is specifically canal by practicability, realism, cooperative, and limited government, and ultimately, private judgement.  As first codified, the limitations expressed in the Act guide the "[SBA] and the head of each Federal agency" to assure that the goals "shall realistically reflect the potential of small business concerns and small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals to perform such contracts and to perform subcontracts under the contracts." n22 The text of 502 is neither vague or unintelligible.  To the contrary, it is clear, plain and intelligible, despite Petitioner's claim that the term "goal" has no substantive meaning in Section 502. n23 Strangely, Petitioner does not link a second operative word that has significant meaning in remedial legislation.  The word is "opportunity." Repetition of a portion of Section 502 demonstrates the point: "Notwithstanding the Government-wide goal, each agency shall have an annual goal that presents . . . the maximum practical opportunity" for small businesses and concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.  \b \i0 \ul0 [*18]\b0 \i0 \ul0   . . ." 15 U.S.C. \'a7 644(g).  The word "opportunity" has a meaning which, in the context of the word "goal", are both quite clear standards.

\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n23 Petitioner's Reply Brief at 5, Adarand, 16 F.3d 1537. To conclude that the term has no substance is to belie the manner in which the word is used in the context of Section 502.  Its meaning and the substance of its meaning must be read in the light of the context of the Act.  Many words isolated from other words may not have an intelligible meaning, but that is not the case here.  Reference to leading dictionaries aid Amici's view that the word goal has meaning and purpose.  The 1899 edition of the UNIVERSAL DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE 2337 (Robert Hunter and Charles Morris eds. 1899), defines the terms goal as "The final purpose or aim; the end at which a person aims, or to which a design is directed; the end.  The 1945 edition of WEBSTER'S NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY UNABRIDGED 1071 (2d ed. 1945), defines goal as "[T]he end to which a design tends; aim; purpose . . . to seek, reach . . . a goal. . . ." THE WEBSTER'S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE UNABRIDGED 972 (Philip Babcock Grove ed. 1986), defines goal as "The end toward which effort . . . is directed."
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  \b \i0 \ul0 [*19]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Three dictionaries covering a period of nearly one hundred years make the case for a meaning that is more than descriptive.  The word opportunity is an active word.  The 1899 edition of the UNIVERSAL DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE 3335, defines "opportunity" as "Fit, opportune, or convenient times . . ., a . . . suitable or propitious occasion or chance. n24 The 1948 edition of WEBSTER'S NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY OF ENGLISH AND LANGUAGE UNABRIDGED defines "opportunity" as "a time or place favorable for executing a purpose; suitable combination of conditions; suitable occasion; chance." The 1986 version of WEBSTER'S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY defines "opportunity" as "a combination of circumstances, time and place suitable or favorable for a particular activity or action . . . an advantageous circumstance or combination of circumstances, esp. when affecting security, wealth, or freedom (as from constraint) . . . a time, place, or condition favoring advancement or progress . . . SYN OCCASION, CHANCE, BREAK, TIME: OPPORTUNITY indicates a combination of circumstances facilitating a certain action or inviting a certain decision. . . ." n25 Amici assert that when the terms \b \i0 \ul0 [*20]\b0 \i0 \ul0   "goal" and "opportunity" are read in the context of the remedial purpose of the Act, there is no basis to Petitioner's claim that Congress gave no substantive guidance, or imposed no limitations, on federal agencies in carrying out congressional will under Section 502.  Clearly, federal agencies could reasonably interpret that Congress expected these agencies, in the exercise of their discretion, and within the plain meaning of the terms of the Act, to create "a combination of circumstances facilitating a certain action or inviting a certain decision." n26 Amici agree with Justice Frankfurter's opinion that "[a] problem in statutory construction can seriously bother courts only when there is a contest between probabilities of meaning," n27 which is absent in this case.

\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n28 As the legislative history of Section 502 shows, Congress mandates a government-wide procurement goal of no less than 20% for small business, and no less than 5% for DBEs.  See H. R. CONF. REP. NO. 1070, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 73 (1988), reprinted in 1988 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5401, 5507, which states that "each procuring agency is required to establish a similar goal consistent with its mission, and such goals shall not be less than the government-wide goal established by the President."
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n29 That members of Congress were both aware and concerned about the dearth of minority participation in the commerce of the nation is demonstrated by the testimony of Sen. Sasser in connection with S. 1993 and H.R. 1807, who said:
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Minorities are still less likely to own a small business.  Some 1.8% of the minority population owned a business in 1982 compared with 6.4 percent of all business owners.  Moreover, minority-owned firms are smaller than nonminority businesses with lower sales and fewer employees . . .  The question of minority business ownership is one that demands continued attention by this committee and by the entire Congress . . .  These hearings and the Chairman's legislative proposal . . . are an effort to get the 8(a) program to focus on its original statutory objective.  That objective is simply enough -- to boost minority ownership of small businesses that can compete in a competitive market.

\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 During these hearings, Sen. Kerry's testimony also is instructive.  Sen.

Even short of the specific concerns expressed in the hearings, Congress is better equipped to make assumptions and draw the same conclusion because the collective assumptions of the representative branch is not done without presumed Member scrutiny.  This is no doubt why in the Fullilove decision, "it was within Congressional power to act on the assumption that in the past some non-minority businesses may have reaped competitive benefit over the years from the virtual exclusion of minority firms from these contracting opportunities."

The enactment of 502 of Small Business Act in 1988 demonstrates continuous concerns by Congress about the plight of minority and small businesses in the free market doing business with the government.  These concerns also were expressed in the 1978 amendments to the Small Business Act, with the enactment of Section 221, Pub. L. No. 95-507, 92 Stat. 1770. This law requires federal agencies, in cooperation with the Small Business Administration, to establish "realistic goals" for DBE opportunities in federal government contracts in excess of $ 10.000, n33 and no limitation exist in the law or Section 502 which would cut off the authority exercised by CFLHD. n34

In some measure, each of these administrations have attempted "to strive to eliminate obstacles to the growth of small business." n37 In 1983, President Reagan signed an Executive Order requiring federal agencies to establish objectives for encouraging prime contractors to utilize minority enterprises.

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 IV.  THE DECISION OF THE PRIME CONTRACTOR TO ACTIVATE THE SCC CLAUSE AND THE ENSUING OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE BY THE PRIME CONTRACTOR AND SUBCONTRACTOR IS A PRIVATE ACT
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Amici assert that the selection of the DBE was a private action n41 and not a state action implicating either the Fourteenth or Fifth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.  The choice to act on the continuing invitation under the SCC was not a governmental action. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n41 Amici can agree with Petitioner's concession to the extent that it asserts that "a private individual . . . has made the decision to issue a subcontract . . ." Brief of Petitioner at 20, Adarand, 63 U.S.L.W. 3255.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The bidding process went forward by Mountain Gravel to subcontract for the guardrail systems.  Petitioner and a certified DBE n42 responded to the invitation to \b \i0 \ul0 [*26]\b0 \i0 \ul0   offer and Mountain Gravel, acting on the continuing invitation under the SCC, independently, without compulsion, and by private action, awarded the subcontract. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n42 "The record gives no indication of the racial composition Adarand's ownership, although its general manager is a white male and its stockholders include the general manager's wife and two other women." Adarand, 16 F.3d at 1542 n.8.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 If Mountain Gravel had not acted on the continuing invitation, the DBE would, we think, absent some common law right of action, have no standing, or a federal right of action against Mountain Gravel or the DOT to compel Mountain Gravel to act on the SCC, (unless there exist a federal private right of action).  Nor would the DBE have had a right of action under the Fifth Amendment to enjoin Petitioner from being selected to build the guardrail, if Petitioner had been the choice of the prime contractor as the subcontractor.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Hence, this case is not like the segregation case in the District of Columbia where the state compelled the action held to be a denial of equal protection under the Fifth Amendment. n43 The fact that the SCC was an incentive to implement the goal and opportunity \b \i0 \ul0 [*27]\b0 \i0 \ul0   provision of Section 502, cannot be determined (short of speculation) that Mountain Gravel considered it to be in its best business interest only to select a DBE. n44 Other market place and efficiency considerations could logically influence a prime contractor's discretion to avoid the incentive allowing compensation for providing "direct assistance to disadvantaged subcontractors in acquiring necessary bonding, obtaining price quotations, analyzing plans and specifications, and planning and management of the work." n45 Where, as here, the prime contractor is free to accept, or not to accept the invitation under the SCC, the government is a mere bystander at this point in the same manner that it is a bystander in waiting, if, and until, the prime contractor decides to exercise the power of acceptance under the terms of the SCC.  Amici submit that it is because Congress may not always compel private actions in the market place that it may create incentives which may cause an actor to act on its own in ways that the government may be constrained to do. n46

\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n47 Amici notes that the only evidence Mountain Gravel's state of mind is that it "felt compelled to give the subcontract of the guardrail work to Gonzales Construction." Brief of Petitioners at 10-11, Adarand, 63 U.S.L.W. 3255. Respectfully, it is submitted that if today African-Americans cannot perceive racism when the history of the country and certain localities acted upon it; Petitioner (through Mountain Gavel's) claim about how Mountain Gravel "felt" ought not to be weighted in fact to validate a perception of racism when none is present in the SCC about which Petitioner complains.  See Podberesky v. Kirwin, No. 93-2527, slip op. at 8-9 (4th Cir. Oct. 27, 1994).  The history of advantage is as relevant as history of disadvantage and racial denial as written in history books.  Id. at 8.
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n48 Id. at 115; Record, supra note 44.  The Court has recently stated that "[t]he mere fact a business is subject to state regulation does not by itself convert its action into that of the State for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment . . .  The complaining party must . . . show that 'there is a sufficiently close nexus between the State and the challenged action of the regulated party entity so that the action of the latter may be fairly treated as that of the State itself.'" Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. 991, 1004-05 (1982)(internal citation omitted).  The Court added that "Second, although the factual setting of each case will be significant, our precedents indicate that a State normally can be held responsible for a private decision only when it has exercised coercive power, or has provided such significant encouragement, either overt or covert., that the choice must in law be deemed to be that of the State . . .  Third, the required nexus may be present if the private entity has exercised powers that are traditionally the exclusive prerogative of the State." Id. It is submitted that the SCC is a mere remedial expedient inviting a private act for a valuable government privilege.  By its terms, it is not a coercive device, and is proper device in furtherance of the Spending Clause of the Constitution.  Fullilove, 448 U.S. at 474. Nor, in the exercise of its discretion, is the prime contractor required to "exercise powers that are traditionally the exclusive prerogatives of the State.'" Blum, 457 U.S. at 1005. Thus, no state action is involved when a SCC is merely included in a federal contract inviting an offer to do a discretionary, future act, if exercised.  See Valley Forge College v. Americans United, 454 U.S. 464, 473 (1982); Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 751, 753 (1984); Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S.    , 112 S.Ct. 2130 (1992), regarding prudential limits.
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Finally, it is submitted, the organic statute, appropriation acts and implementing procurement policy (SCC) under the delegation doctrine appear to be equally as constitutional in substance and methodology as government regulations that limit funds to state agencies that encourage or promote abortion as a method of family planning.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 A critical question posed by this case, sub judice, is whether the Constitution prohibits Congress and the Executive Branch from exercising its broad delegation of power (and the receipt thereof) that result in the a remedial expedient that does not trammel on the rights of White people?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Petitioner has stipulated "that Section 502 satisfies the evidentiary requirements of [Fullilove v.

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Congress passed the Public Works Employment Act of 1977 which provided financial assistance to build public facilities.  The Act required that absent an administrative waiver, 10% of the funds granted for the projects had to be used to procure services or supplies from minority business enterprises ("MBEs").  Under the program, the grantees \b \i0 \ul0 [*30]\b0 \i0 \ul0   and their prime contractors, were required to seek out all available, qualified, bona fide MBEs.  MBEs could be awarded the set-aside even though their bids were not the lowest, and responsive bid -- so long as the higher bids when challenged, were found to reflect merely attempts to cover costs inflated by the present effects of prior disadvantaged and discrimination.  A grantee under the program could waive the set-aside.  A complaint procedure existed under the program to assure that only bona fide MBEs participated therein.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Petitioner in Fullilove sued alleging that this congressionally created program violated the Fourteenth and Fifth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.  They challenged the program on three grounds: (1) that the set-aside program was invalid on its face; (2) that the MBE program deprived nonminority business of access to at least some portion of the government contracting opportunities generated by the Act; and (3) that Congress made no findings to support the need for the set-aside provision.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Court rejected all of these claims.  First, the Court determined that Congress is a competent and the most qualifies body to determine the remedial needs of \b \i0 \ul0 [*31]\b0 \i0 \ul0   its citizens, even when the remedy is based on race-conscious criteria. n50 Secondly, the Court determined that "when effectuating a limited and properly tailored remedy to cure the effects of prior discrimination, such a 'sharing of the burden' by innocent parties is not impermissible . . .  The actual 'burden' shouldered by nonminority firms is relatively light. . . ." n51 Third, the Court determined that "Congress is not expected to act as though it were duty bound to find facts and make conclusions of law.  The creation of national rules for the governance of our society simply does not entail the same concept of recordmaking that is appropriate to a judicial or administrative proceeding." n52

However, if the DBE subcontractor subcontracts only insignificant portions of the subcontract while still doing the major portion of the work, the prime contractor may receive full compensation under this provision.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The SCC is an instrument which invites the activation of a private party's own judgment rather than joint or collective compulsion of it.  Amici submit that the SCC is so narrowly tailored that it guarantees nothing to DBEs.  Under the SCC, DBEs must wait for the activation of the SCC by prime contractors, such as Mountain Gravel, who for reasons of their own may or may not respond to the invitation of offer by the government to use a DBE as a subcontractor. n54 The SCC is self-tailored because it is neither mandatory or wrought with penalty.  The intent of the government, clearly stated in the text of the SCC, is to invite the prime contractor to participate in the goal and opportunity program authorized by Section \b \i0 \ul0 [*35]\b0 \i0 \ul0   502, and implemented by the selected remedial expedient.  The decision not to use a DBE for whatever reason requires no justification or excuse by the prime contractor to be in compliance with the overall contract.  The terms of the SCC are less demanding than the waiver provision that exists in Fullilove. n55 Here, the prime contractor is neither required to seek a waiver from, or to ask permission of the government to do anything prior to responding, or not responding to the invitation for offer under the SCC.  The SCC creates no monopoly on government funds. n56 If a monopoly exist, it may be for the substantial expenditure of federal dollars to persons other than DBEs, the very opposite which undergirds the intent of Congress under of Section 502 of shared opportunity for wealth.  Amici again emphasize that both Congress, and DOT leave this judgment, a priori, in the sole discretion of private parties. n57 Amici again note that the prime contractor is free to select DBE subcontractors who are White n58 and certified by any government agency.  Hence, Amici, respectfully, requests the Court to ponder whether a claim under the Fifth Amendment would be cognizable if Mountain Gravel \b \i0 \ul0 [*36]\b0 \i0 \ul0   had subcontracted, under the self-tailored terms of the SCC, the work to a DBE that happened to be White as indeed it can.

\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n56 Id. at 532 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  The SCC is no historical monument.  It will teach Americans nothing about the costs associated with a sovereign's grant of exclusive privileges because, and it might surprise the population to discover, there are no sovereign exclusive guarantees to DBEs involved in this case.  Id. What the SCC will teach is that DBEs must wait on prime contractors to decide if it is in their interests or the interest of the market place to activate the SCC.  Clearly, under the SCC program, "the provision stigmatizes as inferior neither a minority firm that benefits from it nor a nonminority firm that is burdened by it." Id. at 521 (Marshall, J., concurring in judgment).
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n57 Id. at 484 ("Failure of nonminority firms to receive certain contracts is, of course, an incidental consequence of the program, not part of its objective; similarly, past impairment of minority-owned access to public contracting opportunities may have been an incidental consequence of 'business as usual' by public contracting agencies and among prime contractors.").

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Amici submits that any claim by Petitioner that it has been abused has been correctly rejected by the district court below, as affirmed by the decision of the Tenth Circuit herein on review.  The Tenth Circuit's decision persuasively provides, we think, the most reasonable decisional direction for the Court take:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The district court found that the challenged program satisfies Fullilove because it serves important governmental objectives and is substantially related to achievement of those objectives.  790 F.Supp. at 244. The district court concluded that the challenged program was narrowly tailored to achieve its statutory objectives because it does not mandate its provisions in an inflexible manner.  It ensures minimum impact on non-DBEs because '[t]o qualify for DBE status a business must demonstrate, via the annual certification process, that it is a bona fide DBE, eligible to participate in the program.  The annual certification mechanism is reasonably calculated to insure legitimate qualified participants, so that the program does not become overinclusive in the sense of tolerating abuse of the program by non-DBEs.  Likewise the program is not underinclusive \b \i0 \ul0 [*38]\b0 \i0 \ul0   since it provides that businesses not entitled to the presumption of DBEs status may apply for certification and establish their qualifications to participate.  Id. . . .  Because eligibility is based on economic disadvantage, non-minority-owned businesses also are eligible to participate.  The SCC program is not overinclusive since minority businesses that do not satisfy the economic criteria cannot qualify for DBE status.  Furthermore, the SCC program is 'appropriately limited in extent and duration' because federal procurement and construction contracting practices are subject to regular 'reassessment and reevaluation by Congress.' See Fullilove, 488 U.S. at 489 (opinion of Burger, C.J.). n59

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 V.  CONCLUSION
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In conclusion, Amici submit that Petitioner's attempt to invite the Court to divert its attention to Richmond v. J. A. Croson n60 as the standard for judicial review is misplaced because the facts are different, n61 the political racial makeup (apparently relevant in Croson) of the political decision makers is different, n62 the constitutional \b \i0 \ul0 [*39]\b0 \i0 \ul0   authority and the assignment of power under our instrument of rule is different, n63 and the remedial expedient, the SCC, is different.  Amici assert that the program involved in this appeal would have been upheld under less than strict scrutiny review if it had preceded the Court's decision in Fullilove.

\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n61 Paralleling a statement made by Justice Scalia in Croson relative to Fullilove, Amici do not believe that decision in Croson controls the appeal before this Court.  Id. at 552.
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n62 Id. at 495 (O'Connor, J.); id. at 553-554 (Marshall, J., dissenting).  Amici, and the deep and rich history to which we are rooted, and the kaleidoscope of injustices that Amici and our ancestors have experienced supports our determination that there is something worthy of consideration in Professor Ely's words that require them to be spread on the record: "When the group that controls the decision making process classifies so as to advantage a minority and disadvantage itself, the reasons for being unusually suspicious, and, consequently, employing a stringent brand of review are lacking.  A White majority is unlikely to disadvantage itself for reasons of racial prejudice; nor is it likely to be tempted either to underestimate the needs and secrets of Whites relative to those of others, or to overestimate the cost of devising an alternative classification that would extend to certain Whites the advantages generally extended to Blacks . . ." JOHN HART ELY, The Constitutionality of Reverse Discrimination, 41 U. CHI. L. REV. 723, 735-736 (1974). A careful reading of the facts of this case and the reality of the SCC program does not rise the level of undue disadvantage to Whites which would, we think, cause the Court to arouse the Croson decision and to transport it to the seat of the National Government.
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n63 Compare Fullilove, 488 U.S. at 510 (Powell, J., concurring) with Croson, 488 U.S. at 486-493, 499-505 (opinion of the Court).
