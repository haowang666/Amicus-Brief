\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Minority Media and Telecommunications Council ("MMTC"), formed in 1986, is an association of approximately one hundred lawyers, engineers and scholars who provide pro bono support to civil rights organizations in policy and rulemaking matters before the FCC.  MMTC promotes FCC rules and private industry initiatives aimed at increasing opportunities for minorities to own media and telecommunications facilities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The League of United Latin American Citizens ("LULAC"), the nation's largest Hispanic organization, is concerned with advancing the civil rights and promoting the educational, economic and social well being of Hispanic Americans in the United States.  Founded in 1929, LULAC has approximately 33,000 dues-paying members.  Several of its local councils and state associations have been active since 1990 in challenges to the FCC license renewal applications of broadcasters who appear to be violating the FCC's broadcast equal employment opportunity rule, 47 C.F.R. \'a7 73.2080 (1993) (the "EEO Rule").
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Office of Communication of the United Church of Christ ("OC/UCC"), founded in 1965, is an instrumentality of the United Church of Christ, a Protestant denomination of approximately 1.6 million members nationwide.  OC/UCC was the first program of national scope aimed at promoting racial diversity in the mass media.  Its pioneering work in integrating southern television stations led to the landmark ruling affirming the standing of listeners and viewers to participate in broadcast licensing proceedings.  Office of Communication of the United Church of Christ v. FCC, 359 F.2d 994 (D.C. Cir. 1966). OC/UCC played an instrumental role in developing the EEO Rule.  It has participated in dozens of FCC proceedings over the past three decades as an advocate for minorities in the mass media and in telecommunications.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The National Hispanic Media Coalition ("NHMC"), founded in 1986, is an association of two dozen constituent organizations representing all facets of Hispanic American business, consumer, educational and cultural life.  NHMC strives to stimulate employment and ownership opportunities for Hispanics in all mass media.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Communications Task Force ("CTF"), founded in 1986, is an association primarily composed of African American lawyers and media professionals.  CTF sponsors public policy forums aimed at expanding the public dialogue over minority opportunity in the media and telecommunications.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The National Association of Black Owned Broadcasters ("NABOB"), founded in 1976, is the trade association of African Americans who own radio and television stations.  Virtually all of the approximately 200 African American owned broadcast stations, are affiliated with NABOB.  NABOB conducts management training conferences for its members, encourages advertising and financial investments in African American owned stations, and seeks to protect the interests of African American broadcast companies.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The American Hispanic Owned Radio Association ("AHORA") was founded in 1991 to promote business opportunities for Hispanic American broadcasters.  AHORA seeks to increase the number of Hispanic Americans in the broadcasting industry, promote the interests of the Hispanic community of the United States, and protect the overall interests of the Hispanic American broadcasting industry.  Virtually all of the approximately 100 Hispanic owned radio stations are affiliated with AHORA.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Emerging Telecommunications Entrepreneurs Association ("ETEA"), founded in 1994, is the association of minority entrepreneurs who have won permits to construct FCC licensed facilities in the Interactive Video and Data Service (IVDS).  ETEA seeks to develop economic and marketing support networks among minority IVDS operators, as well as encourage the FCC to provide economic opportunities for minority entrepreneurs in the interactive video services market.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Each of the amici is intimately involved in promoting congressionally mandated FCC policies which are designed to promote economic opportunity, competition and diversity of viewpoints.

\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Court should leave undisturbed Metro's holding that intermediate scrutiny applies to judicial review of congressionally mandated, narrowly tailored, race conscious programs designed to promote diversity of media ownership.  The Court should also reaffirm that the degree of deference afforded to an administrative agency which faithfully implements a congressional mandate is the same as the degree of deference afforded to Congress.
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 ARGUMENT
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 I.  CONGRESS HAS BROAD DISCRETION TO CONSIDER RACE AS ONE OF THE FACTORS PROMOTING THE FIRST AMENDMENT GOAL OF DIVERSITY OF VIEWPOINTS
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Petitioner apparently now concedes that five Justices in Metro agreed that intermediate scrutiny is the proper standard of review for programs which promote First Amendment values. n3 However, one amicus argues that Metro should be overruled because, inter alia, "it was decided only recently and is not the type of decision upon which ordinary people \b \i0 \ul0 [*5]\b0 \i0 \ul0   have placed reliance" and "there is reason to believe that some justices [sic] in the Metro Broadcasting majority might reconsider their positions in light of developing demographic and political trends." n4 If this Court intends to reconsider Metro, the following is respectfully offered in its defense. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n3 See Petitioner's Brief at 29-30; compare Petition for Writ of Certiorari of Adarand Constructors, Inc. at 12-13 (suggesting that Justice Stevens did not endorse this aspect of Metro because his concurring opinion in Metro "demands that the reasons for racial classifications be 'clearly identified and unquestionably legitimate'", quoting Metro, 497 U.S. at 601 (opinion of Stevens, J.)).  See also Brief Amicus Curiae of the Associated General Contractors of America, Inc. in Support of Petitioner at 8-9 (recognizing that Metro applied intermediate scrutiny).

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In Fullilove v. Klutznick, n5 this Court correctly found that Congress had articulated a substantial governmental interest in \b \i0 \ul0 [*6]\b0 \i0 \ul0   redressing past discrimination. n6 The Fullilove Court directed that a standard approximating "intermediate scrutiny" should be applied in reviewing congressionally mandated, race conscious remedial programs for equal protection purposes. n7

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Metro is a sound example of the principle that "remedy for past wrong is not the exclusive basis upon which racial classification may be justified." n8 In Metro, the Court determined that the FCC's congressionally mandated minority ownership policies serve the important government interest in promoting diversity of viewpoints, n9 thereby justifying the application of an intermediate level of scrutiny similar to that authorized in Fullilove.

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Metro's holding was respectful of the paramount governmental interest in promoting robust public discourse in a multicultural, democratic society.  Viewpoint diversity is an important First Amendment \b \i0 \ul0 [*7]\b0 \i0 \ul0   goal because social and political consensus will emerge from the clash of diverse and often conflicting ideas and beliefs.  Last Term, in Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, n10 this Court reaffirmed that "assuring that the public has access to a multiplicity of information sources is a governmental purpose of the highest order, for it promotes values central to the First Amendment." n11

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In the electronic mass media, diversity is enhanced by governmental efforts to expand the public's access to the media in order to increase the variety of ideas and beliefs disseminated.  In this way, the public interest is served because the public is better informed.  Associated Press v. U.S., 326 U.S. 1, 20 (1945).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Historically, ownership has been viewed as a primary determinant of program diversity. n12 Thus, a well accepted means of enhancing viewpoint diversity has been the development of structural, content-neutral regulations diversifying media ownership.  FCC v. NCCB, 436 U.S. 775, 795 (1978). 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n12 Metro, 497 U.S. at 570-71. The Communications Act is premised on the vesting of the right to speak (creation, selection and editing of content) in the owner of the FCC-licensed facilities.  FCC v. WNCN Listeners Guild, 450 U.S. 582, 596 (1981). Congress and the FCC have both found that minority interests and viewpoints are inadequately represented in the broadcast media.  Metro, 497 U.S. at 588-592. That is why the FCC has implemented policies designed to assist minorities in owning broadcast stations.  Statement of Policy on Minority Ownership of Broadcast Facilities, 68 FCC2d 979, 980 (1978).

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Metro Court concluded that the FCC's minority ownership policies are substantially related to the achievement of the government's diversity goals. n13 The Metro Court deferred to Congress' finding that that the government's substantial interest in promoting viewpoint diversity is enhanced by the inclusion of previously underrepresented minorities in the ownership of the electronic media.  The Court concluded that "the interest in enhancing broadcast diversity is, at the very least, an important governmental objective. . . ." n14

\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n14 Id. at 567. Cf.  Wygant v. Jackson Board of Education, 476 U.S. 267, 288 n. * (1986) (opinion of O'Connor, J.) ("[t]he goal of providing 'role models' . . . should not be confused with the very different goal of promoting racial diversity among the faculty.").
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Congress' mandate for the FCC's minority ownership policies was grounded by an empirical nexus between the race of the owner and the range of viewpoints presented n15 and was not the product of impermissible stereotyping of minority broadcasters or media consumers. n16 Moreover, the policies are content-neutral. n17 \b \i0 \ul0 [*9]\b0 \i0 \ul0   
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n15 Metro, 497 U.S. at 579-82 (citing research findings).  Compare Lamprecht v. FCC, 958 F.2d 382, 393 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (Congress lacked empirical support for a finding that female ownership interests of broadcast facilities is related to the presentation of female viewpoints).
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n16 Metro, 497 U.S. at 579.
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n17 Content-neutral regulations "do not require or prohibit the carriage of particular ideas or points of view.  They do not penalize [speakers] because of the content of their programming.  They do not compel [speakers] to affirm points of view with which they disagree.  They do not produce any net decrease in the amount of available speech.  And they leave [speakers] free to carry whatever programming they wish on all channels not subject to [the regulations]." Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2462. This definition also perfectly fits the policies approved in Metro.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This Court should not require strict scrutiny in evaluating narrowly tailored federal programs such as those in Fullilove or Metro, or the program under consideration in the instant case.  No party or amicus has identified any events, occurring since Metro \b \i0 \ul0 [*10]\b0 \i0 \ul0   was decided, which would compel or even support a decision overruling Metro. Therefore, Metro should remain undisturbed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 II.  AN ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY DECISION WHICH FAITHFULLY IMPLEMENTS A CONGRESSIONAL MANDATE SHOULD BE AFFORDED THE SAME DEFERENCE AS THAT AFFORDED THE CONGRESSIONAL MANDATE
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Petitioner argues that a federal agency's action should only be afforded the lesser degree of deference given the action of a state or local government in City of Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co. n18 rather than the greater degree of deference afforded the action of Congress in Fullilove or Metro. This argument overlooks the important distinctions made by this Court in Croson between federal and state remedial power, and reflects a misunderstanding of the way in which federal agencies function. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n18 488 U.S. 469 (1989).
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Distinguishing between the Court's decisions in Fullilove and Croson, Justice O'Connor explained "that Congress, unlike any State or political subdivision, has a specific constitutional mandate to enforce the dictates of the Fourteenth Amendment." n19 The level of deference afforded Congress may also stem from "an amalgam of its [other] specifically delegated \b \i0 \ul0 [*11]\b0 \i0 \ul0   powers." n20 These powers include the authority to "provide for the . . . general Welfare" pursuant to Congress' spending power, U.S. Const., art. I, \'a7 8, cl. 1; to take necessary and proper action to protect against inequities that have an effect on interstate commerce under the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const., art. I, \'a7 8, cl. 3; and "'to enforce, by appropriate legislation,' the equal protection guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment." n21

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 These constitutionally delegated powers extend to federal agencies.  Petitioner, however, would have this Court treat federal agency actions implementing congressional directives like state or local actions executing state or local goals.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Petitioner's argument fails to recognize the close relationship between Congress and administrative agencies.  As this Court has noted, "[i]n our increasingly complex society, replete with ever changing and more technical problems, Congress simply cannot do its job absent an ability to delegate power under broad general directives." Mistretta v. U.S., 488 U.S. 361, 371-372 (1989). \b \i0 \ul0 [*12]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Agency decisions implementing congressional mandates that implicate but do not run afoul of the Fourteenth Amendment should be construed as any other agency decision should: as part of Congress' plan to achieve Congress' goals. n22 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n22 In Fullilove, this Court recognized that courts should afford "'great weight to the decisions of Congress' even . . . when a congressional program raises equal protection concerns." Fullilove, 448 U.S. at 472 (quoting Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Democratic National Committee, 412 U.S. 94, 102 (1973) (Part I, Burger, J.) (citations omitted).
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Systematic safeguards assure that agencies interpretations, statutory administration, and decisions implement congressional goals.  Congress' oversight of agency actions is expansive, and begins with Congress' power to amend or repeal a statute if it finds that an agency's implementation of the statute is unsatisfactory.  Another "common form of congressional control over regulatory agencies is for the appropriations committees to incorporate policy directives and restrictions in the official reports accompanying appropriations bills." n23 Congress also controls agencies'  \b \i0 \ul0 [*13]\b0 \i0 \ul0   execution of the laws through hearings, n24 committee investigations, studies by the General Accounting Office, informal contacts between members of Congress and agency officials, n25 and nonstatutory controls. n26

See Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, S. Rep. No. 102-92, 102d Cong., 1st Sess. (1991).

The Court recognized that Congress would "be able to further tailor the program based on [the] information" received from congressional monitoring mechanisms and that Congress "may eliminate the preferences when appropriate." n33 This Court did not make a distinction between the FCC implementation of the minority preference system and the congressional directive that mandated the system because Congress determined that the FCC's interpretation bore "the imprimator of longstanding Congressional support and direction." n34 This Court decided that it "must give great weight" to Congress' and the FCC's "joint determination" of the means necessary to promote broadcast diversity. n35

Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. n36 For a unanimous Court in Chevron, Justice Stevens explained that "if a statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question for the court is whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible consruction of the statute." n37 Chevron clarified that agencies may interpret a broad congressional delegation to give a statutory directive substantive meaning.

\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n37 Id. at 843. See also Sullivan v. Everhart, 494 U.S. 83, 89 (1989) (Scalia, J.); id. at 103 (Stevens J., dissenting).  To be "permissible" within the meaning of Chevron, the agency's interpretation of a statute is "rational and consistent with the statute", NLRB v. Food and Commercial Workers, 484 U.S. 112, 123 (1987), and "not in conflict with the plain language of the statute", K Mart Corp. v. Cartier, Inc., 486 U.S 281, 292 (1988). "The word 'permissible' [may be read to be] general enough to embody the range of relevant factors." Breyer, supra n. 26, at 373.  The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \'a7 706 (1976), provides that "the reviewing court [is to] decide all relevant questions of law [and] interpret constitutional and statutory provisions" (emphasis supplied).  Thus, the question for the Court to determine in judging permissibility is partially whether "the particular question [is] one that the agency or the court is more likely to answer correctly. . . ." Breyer, supra n. 25, at 370.  Micromanagement decisions of agency administration are best left to the agency.
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Whether an "agency has special expertise to bear" on either a legal or policy question should weigh heavily towards a permissibility ruling." Breyer, supra n. 25, at 370 ("courts will defer more when the agency has special expertise that it can bring to bear on the legal question.") An agency such as the FCC, with a high degree of expertise in communications, should be afforded a high degree of deference.  Indeed, "[t]he fast moving nature of communications technology, and the loose language of the [Communications Act], provide some basis for believing that Congress intended to allow the FCC a wider latitude than it typically granted to other agencies." National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners v. FCC, 533 F.2d 601, 618 n. 98 (D.C. Cir. 1976).

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This Court has faced numerous situations where an agency's interpretation of an ambiguous phrase added substantive meaning to the minimum set by Congress. n38 No differentiation has been made between an agency's permissible interpretation of a statute and the actual congressional enactments because "Congress . . . exercise[s] the primary legislative function, the administrative agency a secondary one." n39 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n38 Since 1935, "Congress has delegated agencies vast powers under statutes written in the broadest possible language.  The FTC can stop business practices that are 'unfair.' The ICC sets 'reasonable' rates; the FCC simply acts to serve 'public convenience, interest or necessity.'" Stephen G. Breyer, The Legislative Veto After Chadha, 72 Geo. L. J. 785, 788 (1984) (footnotes omitted).  See National Broadcasting Co. v. United States, 319 U.S. 190, 216 (1943) (the FCC has the authority to administer an elaborate radio licensing scheme implementing Congress' directive to promote the "public interest"); Yakas v. United States, 321 U.S. 414, 423 (1944) (the Price Administrator has the authority to fix prices in a flexible manner under Congress' directive to establish such maximum price or prices as in his judgment will be generally fair and equitable and will effectuate the purposes of the Emergency Price Control Act); Mobil Oil Exploration and Producing Southeast, Inc. v. United Distribution Companies, 498 U.S. 211, 224 (1991) (the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission had the authority to raise the price ceiling for gas under the Natural Gas Policy Act despite the absence of a set maximum price ceiling).

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Thus, any function an administrative agency serves is subordinate to Congress' power. n40 Congress is intimately engaged in controlling the development and implementation of agency goals and programs, and it never relinquishes its control.  Failure to afford agencies the same level of deference as that afforded Congress would ignore that connection. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n40 "Any power delegated by Congress is necessarily a subordinate power because it is limited by the terms of the delegating statute." Schwartz, supra n. 39, at 45.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Agency decisions should be reviewed under the same standard as congressional actions because the benefits that accrue from allowing Congress to grant agencies discretion would otherwise be lost. n41 Granting agencies discretion permits flexibility n42 and political participation n43 in the administrative process.  Consequently, to sustain these benefits to the administrative system, deference to Congress should include deference to agencies acting under congressional direction.

\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n41 FCC v. Schreiber, 381 U.S. 279, 290 (1965) (judicial deference to agency determinations "is an outgrowth of the congressional determination that administrative agencies and administrators will be familiar with the industries which they regulate and will be in a better position than federal courts or Congress itself to design procedural rules adapted to the pecularities of the industry and the tasks of the agency involved.") See generally Breyer, supra n. 25, at 368 (one reason courts afford agencies deference is that "the agency knows more about the particular area of law than does the court.").  See also Antonin Scalia, Judicial Deference to Administrative Interpretations of Law, 1989 Duke L.J. 511, 514 (1989) (agencies have an "intense familiarity with the history and purposes of the legislation at issue [as well as a] practical knowledge of what will best effectuate those purposes.")
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n42 See Mobil Oil, 498 U.S. at 224 ("Congress clearly meant to preserve the pricing flexibility" by leaving the ceiling price open).  Agency interpretations of ambiguous phrases allow one phrase to "mean a range of things . . . in light of [the agency's] advancing knowledge [and] in light of the changing political pressures [the agency] feels from Congress. . . ." Scalia, supra n. 41, at 517 (internal parenthesis omitted).  If agencies are not afforded the deference given Congress, they will be limited in their ability to continuously work with Congress to develop statutory aims.
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n43 "[A]n agency to which Congress has delegated policymaking responsibility may, within the limits of that delegation, properly rely upon the incumbent administration's view of wise policy to inform its judgments.  While agencies are not directly accountable to people, the Chief Executive is, and it is entirely appropriate for this political branch of the Government to make such policy choices. . . ." Chevron, 467 U.S. at 865. Justice Scalia states that political accountablity is "assured through direct political pressures upon the Executive and through the indirect political pressure of congressional oversight." Scalia, supra n. 41, at 518.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 If Congress has validly delegated authority to an agency, and the agency has acted within the scope of that authority, then the agency's action should be treated as Congress' action.  Agency actions such as those in Fullilove, Metro and the instant case are entitled to deference because of the close relationships between Congress and the agencies, the congressional oversight ensuring that Congress' goals are implemented and the scope of Congress' delegations not exceeded, and the benefits of maintaining the flexibility inherent in Chevron.
