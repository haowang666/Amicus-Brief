\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights is a diverse coalition of more than 200 national organizations charged with promoting and protecting the rights of all persons in the United States. \b0 \i \ul0 Amici curiae\b0 \i0 \ul0  are civil rights, faith, and community organizations whose constituents will suffer the harmful effects of S.B. 1070 and copycat legislation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 By pursuing "attrition through enforcement," states that enact these laws announce to immigrants and people of color that they are not welcome and will be subjected to constant scrutiny--as well as to the demeaning experience of criminal arrest and detention. These policies not only are unjust; they also create criminal consequences that inherently conflict with congressional policy.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 For these reasons, \b0 \i \ul0 amici\b0 \i0 \ul0  urge affirmance of the injunction. A full list of \b0 \i \ul0 amici\b0 \i0 \ul0  are appended after the conclusion of this brief. n1

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  \b \i0 \ul0 [*2]\b0 \i0 \ul0   SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 If the enjoined provisions of S.B. 1070 are allowed to go into effect, they will work harms on individuals who would not suffer such harms under the federal immigration scheme. Although purportedly targeting "unlawfully present" immigrants, S.B. 1070 will dramatically harm the lives of U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents ("LPRs"), and other individuals across a spectrum of immigration statuses--such as asylum seekers and victims of violent crimes--in ways that run counter to the federal immigration scheme.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 S.B. 1070 endangers a broad swath of people in large part because it misapprehends \b \i0 \ul0 [**10]\b0 \i0 \ul0   federal immigration law. Underlying S.B. 1070 are two fallacies. The first is that each person fits into one of two categories--those who are "lawfully present" and those who are not. The second is that Arizona law enforcement officers can readily distinguish between these categories by simply reviewing a certain set of federally mandated documents, or by calling the federal government on the telephone.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In reality, even U.S. citizens often will not be readily identifiable; and where non-citizens are concerned, determining a person's immigration status requires a nuanced legal inquiry, which cannot be performed by police on the beat. Moreover, many non-citizens whom the federal government permits to be in this country will lack documentary proof of that permission.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 On top of these erroneous premises, S.B. 1070 layers a system of criminal consequences that run roughshod over the critical distinctions between  \b \i0 \ul0 [*3]\b0 \i0 \ul0   criminal law and civil immigration law. For example. Section 3 will subject to arrest and prosecution many thousands of people who, under the federal scheme, are not criminally liable. And Section 6 superimposes Arizona officers' \b0 \i \ul0 state criminal\b0 \i0 \ul0  warrantless arrest \b \i0 \ul0 [**11]\b0 \i0 \ul0   authority onto \b0 \i \ul0 federal civil\b0 \i0 \ul0  immigration enforcement. Even federal officers are generally not authorized to make warrantless arrests.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 S.B. 1070 has spawned a slew of copycat laws in other states seeking "attrition through enforcement." n2 The Court's decision in this case will thus shape the fates of people nationwide. In states such as Utah, Indiana, Georgia, Alabama, and South Carolina, n3 people of color will be subjected to constant scrutiny regarding their immigration status--and to the demeaning experience of criminal arrest and detention. S.B. 1070 and its copycats thus divide our nation between those regions where people of all ethnicities can freely travel, live, and work--and those where they cannot.

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In the face of S.B. 1070's plain language, Petitioners ask the Court to identify some narrow reading of the statute, in the hope that the law might survive this facial challenge. The Court should not strain to identify such a legal fiction. The stated motives of its proponents, the stated understandings of its would-be enforcers, and real-world evidence all belie Petitioners'  \b \i0 \ul0 [**12]\b0 \i0 \ul0   theoretical argument that S.B. 1070 can be implemented in a manner consistent with the Constitution.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  \b \i0 \ul0 [*4]\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b \i0 \ul0 ARGUMENT\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I. THOUGH PURPORTEDLY TARGETED AT "UNLAWFUL PRESENCE," S.B. 1070 WILL HARM U.S. CITIZENS.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 A crucial flaw of S.B. 1070 is the assumption that officers can determine "lawful presence" on the spot, simply by looking at a person's documents or by placing a phone call to the federal government. This "papers please" approach is one not generally pursued by federal agents, and is unworkable for the reasons discussed herein. Chief among them is the fact that U.S. citizens comprise the largest group of undocumented people in the United States. Many U.S. citizens do not carry--or even \b0 \i \ul0 own\b0 \i0 \ul0 --the sort of "papers" that the Arizona legislature expects them to possess at all times. These individuals will be at risk of frequent, drawn-out detention, and the demeaning experience of criminal arrest.
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A. S.B. 1070 will require U.S. citizens to carry "papers" at all times--or run the risk of criminal detention.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 S.B. 1070 and its copycats will have an unprecedented effect on the lives of U.S. citizens. Section 2(B), the "stop and verify" provision, requires \b \i0 \ul0 [**13]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Arizona police to determine the immigration status of any person they stop if "reasonable suspicion" exists to believe the person is "unlawfully present" in the United States. n4 Citizens will therefore have to carry  \b \i0 \ul0 [*5]\b0 \i0 \ul0   their "papers" at all times or face the risk of lengthy detention and false arrest. n5

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 U.S. citizens in Arizona have already begun to experience the ramifications of "papers please" policing. \b \i0 \ul0 Jim Shee\b0 \i0 \ul0  n7 is a seventy-one-year-old U.S. citizen of Spanish and Chinese ancestry. Despite having lived in Arizona his entire life, he is now being forced to suffer through the indignity of being repeatedly forced to prove his citizenship. On April 6, 2010, Mr. Shee was stopped for no apparent reason and questioned by a Phoenix police officer, who demanded to see his "papers." He was not given a citation. A similar sequence played out again in Yuma a mere ten days later.

In Arizona, the Department of Public Safety makes well over 500,000 stops per year. n8 The vast  \b \i0 \ul0 [*6]\b0 \i0 \ul0   majority of stops are for minor traffic or equipment violations. n9 As in Mr. Shee's case, over ninety-eight \b \i0 \ul0 [**15]\b0 \i0 \ul0   percent do not result in arrest. n10 S.B. 1070 will transform these routine traffic stops into mini-trials where detained citizens bear the burden of proving their status.

Mr. Villa currently attends Arizona State University, but he is a resident of New Mexico, a state which does not require proof of U.S. citizenship to obtain a driver's license.

This would have been true, for instance, if Mr. Shee had forgotten his driver's license at home. Car passengers, joggers, hikers, and bicyclists can also be stopped, and are not likely to have papers with them. People whose birth certificates constitute their only proof of citizenship \b \i0 \ul0 [**18]\b0 \i0 \ul0   logically store them away in safe, relatively inaccessible places.

On a recent afternoon at a lunch buffet, her deaf seven-year-old daughter crossed in front of a white man whom she did not hear coming, causing him to bobble his plate. Furious, the man intentionally poured barbecue sauce on top of the young girl. He yelled anti-immigrant epithets at her while she struggled to her feet.
