In accordance with Supreme Court Rule 37.6, AZEIR avows that no counsel for any party in this case authored this brief in whole or in part. Additionally, no party nor any counsel for a party has made a monetary contribution intended to fund the preparation or submission of this brief.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Arizona Employers for Immigration Reform ("AZEIR") is a grass roots organization comprised of 350 small, medium, and large businesses dedicated to sensible federal immigration reform. In furtherance of this goal, AZEIR seeks to inform the public and elected officials about the facts of local and state immigration enforcement efforts. AZEIR believes sensible immigration reform must come from the federal government and must address economic and labor concerns as well as border security.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Arizona Hispanic Chamber of Commerce ("AZHCC") is a membership trade association that advocates on behalf of Latino-owned businesses in Arizona. AZHCC seeks to empower Latino-owned businesses to succeed in the state, national, and global economy. Consistent with this goal, AZHCC is a proponent of pragmatic federal immigration reform that respects Latino-owned business and does not hurt Arizona's or the national economy.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The American Subcontractor's Association of Arizona ("ASA") is a membership trade association with over 5,000 subcontractors, specialty trade contractors,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*2]\b0 \i0 \ul0   suppliers, and service providers serving Arizona's construction industry. ASA is dedicated to improving the business environment for all segments of the construction industry, working at both the federal and state level to protect subcontractors' rights. The ASA is concerned about the effect laws like S.B. 1070 will have on Arizona's construction industry--for instance, that it will discourage skilled Hispanic laborers from returning to Arizona when the economy recovers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Hill & Usher, L.L.C., is an Arizona insurance company that insures businesses and individuals, including many construction companies. Hill & Usher joins this brief because it is worried about the burden S.B. 1070 imposes on the commercial insurance industry. For instance, proponents of S.B. 1070 argue that businesses should employ convicts to mitigate labor shortages caused by the law. Needless to say, forcing businesses to hire convicts, many of them violent felons, will greatly affect commercial insurance in Arizona.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 While none of these \b0 \i \ul0 amici curiae\b0 \i0 \ul0  support unfettered illegal immigration, they oppose Arizona's immigration law, S.B. 1070, as an improper exercise of state power, a threat to our national free market economy, and damaging to Arizona's and the nation's business reputation.

\par \pard 
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The principal parties direct their briefs to the issue of federal preemption, that is, whether Arizona's immigration law, S.B. 1070, conflicts with Congress's plenary authority to regulate immigration or with the  \b \i0 \ul0 [*3]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \'a7 11.01, \b0 \i \ul0 et seq.\b0 \i0 \ul0  But preemption focuses the analysis on the scope of federal and state power while ignoring an equally important issue--namely, S.B. 1070's negative impact on interstate commerce. S.B. 1070 affects other states and the national economy as a whole. The law violates the Dormant Commerce Clause.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 A state law violates the Dormant Commerce Clause when (1) it discriminates against out of state interests, or (2) it burdens interstate commerce such that the burden outweighs the law's putative benefits. As an initial matter, S.B. 1070 is discriminatory.  \b \i0 \ul0 [**8]\b0 \i0 \ul0   It encourages immigrants to move to other states, thereby externalizing the supposed costs of unauthorized immigration to these states. Additionally, S.B. 1070 burdens commerce. It raises the price of produce by driving away migrant agricultural workers. It imposes costs on out of state businesses with operations in Arizona. And, by discouraging immigration, S.B. 1070 depletes the national tax base and labor pool.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 What is more, the supposed benefits of S.B. 1070 are illusory and do not outweigh its burdens. Arizona claims it enacted S.B. 1070 to address the severe fiscal and economic effects of unauthorized immigrants --specifically, the rising costs of incarceration, education, and health care. But Arizona's contentions lack empirical support. To the contrary, unauthorized immigrants provide a net benefit to state economies.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In short, S.B. 1070 violates the Dormant Commerce Clause, discriminates against other states, and it burdens interstate commerce without any real local benefit. Unfortunately, several states--Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, South Carolina, Utah--have enacted laws  \b \i0 \ul0 [*4]\b0 \i0 \ul0   similar to S.B. 1070. Therefore, it is necessary for this court to strike S.B. 1070; otherwise \b \i0 \ul0 [**9]\b0 \i0 \ul0   the burden it imposes on commerce will metastasize.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I. STATE IMMIGRATION LAWS AFFECT INTERSTATE COMMERCE\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The National Government's authority to regulate immigration arises out of its power to establish a "uniform rule of Naturalization," its power to regulate commerce, and its authority over foreign affairs. \b0 \i \ul0 Toll v. Moreno,\b0 \i0 \ul0  458 U.S. 1, 10 (1982). Over the years, this court has repeatedly invoked Congress's power under the Constitution's Commerce Clause, U.S. Const, art. 1, \'a7 8, cl. 3, to strike state regulation of immigration. \b0 \i \ul0 See \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 The Passenger Cases,\b0 \i0 \ul0  48 U.S. 283 (1849) (striking state immigration statute with four justices in the majority invoking federal commerce power); \b0 \i \ul0 Henderson v. Mayor of City of New York, et al,\b0 \i0 \ul0  92 U.S. 259, 273 (1876), (striking state immigration law as "a regulation which imposes onerous, perhaps impossible conditions on those engaged in active commerce"); \b0 \i \ul0 Chy Lung v. Freeman, et al,\b0 \i0 \ul0  92 U.S. 275, 279 (1876) (invalidating a California immigration statute as violative of the Commerce Clause); \b0 \i \ul0 Cf. \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 The Head Money Cases,\b0 \i0 \ul0  112 U.S. 580, 595 (1884) (upholding \b \i0 \ul0 [**10]\b0 \i0 \ul0   a federal immigration statute because immigration is a branch of foreign commerce).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The foregoing cases invalidated state immigration laws as violative of the federal government's power to regulate foreign commerce. The Commerce Clause,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*5]\b0 \i0 \ul0   however, also grants Congress plenary power to regulate interstate commerce. And while few cases have addressed this issue, state immigration regulation certainly affects interstate commerce:
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0 It is undeniable that entry of foreign nationals could affect both foreign and interstate commerce. Indeed, one can assume that many individuals enter the United States illegally because of their desire to find better economic opportunities here. Such individuals provide an inexpensive source of federal labor and a market for domestic goods and services, thereby affecting both interstate and foreign commerce.

\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 n2 The Arizona District Court below that first enjoined portions of S.B. 1070 found that "the regulation of immigration does have an impact on interstate commerce." \b0 \i \ul0 United States v. Arizona,\b0 \i0 \ul0  703 F.Supp. 2d 980, 1003 (D.Ariz. 2010). The court made this finding while analyzing a portion of section 5 of S.B. 1070 that is not at issue here. That portion, codified at Ariz. Rev. Stat. \'a7 13-2929, makes it a crime to transport, conceal, or harbor an unauthorized immigrant. The United States contended below that this section violated the Commerce Clause because it restricted interstate movement of aliens. While agreeing that such a violation is possible, the District Court determined the United States had not made an adequate showing.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 If state immigration laws affect interstate commerce, then they are potentially void under Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce. In particular,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*6]\b0 \i0 \ul0   state immigration laws may violate the Dormant Commerce Clause--that is, the implied restraint on state regulation of commerce, even in the absence of a conflicting federal statute. \b0 \i \ul0 United Haulers Ass'n. v. Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Mgm't. Authority,\b0 \i0 \ul0  550 U.S. 330, 338 (2007).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Legal commentators have noted the applicability of the Dormant Commerce Clause to state immigration laws. n3 A Dormant Commerce Clause analysis is particularly apt in analyzing state immigration laws like S.B. 1070 because these laws potentially create "an inconsistant patchwork of varying solutions" to the immigration problem and "the more states that enter this legislative tangle, the stronger the federal government's argument becomes that a uniform national solution is necessary." n4 Indeed, proponents of S.B. 1070 contend that harsh immigration laws are necessary to mitigate the "the fiscal and economic effects of the illegal immigration and unauthorized work by aliens in Arizona [which] are severe." Pet. Br., 6. n5 Thus,  \b \i0 \ul0 [**12]\b0 \i0 \ul0   in en  \b \i0 \ul0 [*7]\b0 \i0 \ul0   acting S.B. 1070, Arizona has essentially attempted to regulate commerce. The law interferes with interstate commerce; it must be invalidated.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 II. ARIZONA'S IMMIGRATION LAW BURDENS COMMERCE\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Commerce Clause grants Congress authority to directly regulate commerce while simultaneously serving \b \i0 \ul0 [**13]\b0 \i0 \ul0   as an implicit restraint on state regulation of commerce in the absence of a conflicting federal statute. \b0 \i \ul0 United Haulers,\b0 \i0 \ul0  550 U.S. at 338. States violate this dormant aspect of the Commerce Clause in two ways. First, a state violates the Dormant Commerce Clause when it discriminates in favor of a local business--that is, it prescribes different treatment of instate and out-of-state economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter. \b0 \i \ul0 Or. \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Waste Sys. v. Dept. of Envtl. Quality,\b0 \i0 \ul0  511 U.S. 93, 99 (1994). This discrimination analysis is obviously not apposite to S.B. 1070. To be sure, the law is patently discriminatory in that it treats unauthorized immigrants differently from authorized aliens and U.S. citizens. S.B. 1070 harms Arizona's economy, as detailed below, even though it does not patently discriminate in favor of Arizona business. n6

\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 n6 Passage of S.B. 1070 sparked an economic boycott of Arizona, particularly in the convention industry. In 2010, the year S.B. 1070 was enacted, Arizona lost $ 141 million in direct spending by convention attendees, 2,761 jobs, $ 86.5 million in lost earnings, $ 253 million in lost economic output, and $ 9.4 million in tax revenues. Marshall Fitz and Angela Kelly, \b0 \i \ul0 Stop the Conference: the Economic and Fiscal Consequences of Conference Cancellations due to Arizona's S.B. 1070,\b0 \i0 \ul0  Center for American Progress Report (Nov. 2010), http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2010/11/pdf/az-tourism.pdf. In fact, the law so tarnished Arizona's image that the state spent $ 250,000 on a marketing campaign to combat its negative associations with illegal immigration. Stephanie Condon, \b0 \i \ul0 Arizona to Spend $ 250K on PR to Combat Negative Immigration Image,\b0 \i0 \ul0  CBS News (July 2, 2010) http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20009593-503544.html.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360  \b \i0 \ul0 [*8]\b0 \i0 \ul0   S.B. 1070 tacitly discriminates by favoring Arizona's economic interests over other states. As noted, proponents of S.B. 1070 assert the law is necessary to address the costs that unauthorized immigrants impose on the state. The supposed costs are likely illusory. But even if unauthorized immigration imposed a cost on Arizona, S.B. 1070 just shifts Arizona's costs to other states. Since its passage, S.B. 1070 has diverted the migration of immigrants to other states. n7 Thus, Arizona is externalizing the presumed costs of immigration on other states. This is an undeniable violation of the Dormant Commerce Clause. \b0 \i \ul0 See \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 United Haulers,\b0 \i0 \ul0  550 U.S. at 345 ("our dormant Commerce Clause cases often find discrimination when a state shifts the costs of regulation to other sates"); \b0 \i \ul0 see also \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 S. Pac. Co. v. Arizona ex rel. Sullivan,\b0 \i0 \ul0  325 U.S. 761, 767-68, n.2 (1945) (when "the burden of state regulation falls on  \b \i0 \ul0 [*9]\b0 \i0 \ul0   interests outside the state, it is unlikely to be alleviated by the operation of those political restraints normally exerted when interests in the state are affected").

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 A state law also violates the Dormant Commerce Clause wherever it burdens commerce or, as in Judge Richard Posner's formulation, "distort[s] the operation of interstate markets." \b0 \i \ul0 Cavel Int'l., Inc. v. Madigan,\b0 \i0 \ul0  500 F.3d 551, 555 (7th Cir. 2007). After all, the purpose of the Dormant Commerce Clause is to protect the nation's free market. \b0 \i \ul0 See \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Wyoming v. Oklahoma,\b0 \i0 \ul0  502 U.S. 437, 469 (1992) (Scalia, J. dissenting) ("our negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence grew out of the notion that the Constitution implicitly established a national free market").
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The test for whether a non-discriminatory state law violates the Dormant Commerce Clause is whether the burden imposed on commerce is excessive in relation to the putative local benefits. \b0 \i \ul0 Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  397 U.S. 137, 142 (1970). In particular, a state law is burdensome when it "undermines a compelling need for national uniformity and regulation," \b0 \i \ul0 GMC v. Tracy,\b0 \i0 \ul0  519 U.S. 278, 299, n. 12 (1997), as is the case with immigration.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Georgia's experience is instructive. Georgia enacted an immigration law, H.B. 87, in 2011 modeled on S.B. 1070. Georgia's law had its \b \i0 \ul0 [**16]\b0 \i0 \ul0   intended effect of scaring off immigrants, many of whom were agricultural workers. Immediately after the law was enacted, a report issued by the Georgia Department of Agriculture found a labor shortage of 11,000 jobs in the state's agricultural  \b \i0 \ul0 [*10]\b0 \i0 \ul0   industry. n8 This shortage forced "Georgia's farmers to leave millions of dollars worth of blueberries, onions, melons and other crops unharvested and rotting in the fields." n9 Millions of dollars worth of crops rotting in the field impacts the national economy by increasing the prices of produce. This court has invoked the Commerce Clause to address far more trivial effects on agriculture losses in the past. \b0 \i \ul0 See, e.g., \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Wickard v. Filburn,\b0 \i0 \ul0  317 U.S. 111 (1942).

Businesses operating in Arizona would have to spend more on employee screening to protect themselves from running afoul of the law if S.B. 1070 were implemented in full. More third-party assistance for employment eligibility and extra human resources staff. n13 This, of course, is  \b \i0 \ul0 [*12]\b0 \i0 \ul0   problematic for \b \i0 \ul0 [**19]\b0 \i0 \ul0   businesses operating solely in Arizona, but it raises Dormant Commerce Clause problems for businesses with national operations that include Arizona.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Proponents of S.B. 1070 refuse to acknowledge this empirical truth: immigrants contribute to the national economy. According to the Pew Hispanic Center there were eight million unauthorized immigrants working in the United States in 2010, representing 5.2% of the national workforce. At least half of these unauthorized immigrants paid taxes. n14 Indeed, in 2010, these immigrants collectively paid $ 11.2 billion in state and local taxes. n15 State and local  \b \i0 \ul0 [*13]\b0 \i0 \ul0   taxes are just one metric and do not account for the value that unauthorized immigrants contribute as workers, consumers, and entrepreneurs. A study by the Center for American Progress found that when undocumented workers are taken out of the economy, the jobs they support through labor consumption, and tax payments disappear as well. n16 Additionally, as the Cato Institute has noted, low-skilled immigrants allow important sectors of the economy, like retail, cleaning, and food preparation, to expand to meet the needs of customers. n17 They help the economy produce a wider array of affordably priced goods, raising the real wages of most Americans. Additionally, by filling gaps in the labor market, immigrants create opportunities \b \i0 \ul0 [**21]\b0 \i0 \ul0   for investment. Laws like S.B. 1070 threaten a sizeable portion of the national tax base and have a deleterious effect on gross domestic product. n18

For example, shortly after the adoption of S.B. 1070, Mexico issued a travel alert to its citizens traveling to Arizona, warning that Arizona had created "a negative political environment for migrant communities and for all Mexican visitors." n19 Also, laws like S.B. 1070 almost certainly discourage companies from doing business in the United States. In 2007, after Alabama passed a law similar to S.B. 1070, a German Mercedes-Benz executive was arrested and a Japanese Honda employee was cited for failing to adequately prove they were in the United States legally. n20 This kind of  \b \i0 \ul0 [*15]\b0 \i0 \ul0   harassment discourages foreign companies from doing business in the United States.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 S.B. 1070 burdens commerce. But the law's burden must outweigh its asserted benefit to violate the Dormant Commerce Clause. A state law's burden outweighs its benefit when there is no rational justification for the law, that is, when its benefits are illusory. \b0 \i \ul0 See \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Raymond Motor Transp., Inc. v. Rice,\b0 \i0 \ul0  434 U.S. 429, 449 (1978) (Blackmun, J. concurring) ("if the safety justifications [for a law] are not illusory, the court will not second guess legislative judgment about their importance in comparison with related burdens on interstate commerce."). For instance, in \b0 \i \ul0 Bibb v. Navajo Freight Lines,\b0 \i0 \ul0  359 U.S. 520 (1959), this court struck down an Illinois law that required all trucks traveling through the state to have rear wheels equipped with contour mud guards. The court was persuaded by the district court's \b \i0 \ul0 [**24]\b0 \i0 \ul0   findings that contour mud flaps required by the law promised no benefit over conventional mud flaps. \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 525. In fact, the contour flaps created a new set of hazards. \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Here, S.B. 1070's supposed benefits are similarly illusory. Arizona contends it passed S.B. 1070 to address an increase in crime caused by unauthorized immigrants and to reduce the cost of incarcerating immigrants. This concern is a fantasy. As a report from the Immigration Policy Center notes, because many immigrants from Mexico and Central America are young men with very low levels of formal education,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*16]\b0 \i0 \ul0   people stereotypically tend to associate them with higher rates of crime and incarceration, n21 This is compounded by the fact that many immigrants enter the country through unauthorized channels, which is seen as a violation of the law, and thus reinforces the association of immigration and crime. The data demonstrates this "criminal" perception is wrong. Among the Immigration Policy Center's findings is that while the undocumented population has doubled since 1994, the violent crime rate in the United States has declined 34.2%, and the property crime rate has fallen 26.4%. Indeed,  \b \i0 \ul0 [**25]\b0 \i0 \ul0   data from the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics shows the violent crime rate in Arizona fell from 545.4 per 100,000 people in 2006 to 481.1 per 100,000 in 2008. n22 Additionally, the incarceration rate of young men is lowest for immigrants, even those who are the least educated. The incarceration rate among native-born men 18-35 in 2000 was 3.5%, which was five times higher than the 0.7% incarceration rate among the foreign born

Much of the cost that report attributes to unauthorized immigration is the amount spent on education and healthcare for the U.S. children  \b \i0 \ul0 [*18]\b0 \i0 \ul0   of unauthorized parents.
