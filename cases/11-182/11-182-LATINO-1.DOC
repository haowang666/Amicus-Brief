No counsel for a party authored this brief in whole or in part and no person other than these \b0 \i \ul0 amici curiae,\b0 \i0 \ul0  their members, or their counsel made a monetary contribution to the preparation or submission of this brief.
\par \fs20 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 National Council of La Raza ("NCLR")\b0 \i0 \ul0  is the largest national Hispanic civil rights and advocacy organization in the United States. Through its network of nearly 300 affiliated community-based organizations ("CBOs"), NCLR reaches millions of Hispanics each year in 41 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. NCLR's seventeen Arizona affiliates (the "Affiliates") will be adversely affected in numerous ways by the provisions of Arizona Senate Bill 1070 ("S.B. 1070") enjoined by the district court. Those provisions will create and/or exacerbate barriers to the Affiliates' efforts to provide essential health, education and social services to Hispanics, particularly to the citizens and lawful residents of Arizona who happen to reside in households that include undocumented persons.
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The United\b0 \i0 \ul0  States \b \i0 \ul0 Hispanic Chamber of Commerce ("USHCC")\b0 \i0 \ul0  actively promotes the economic growth and development of Hispanic entrepreneurs and represents the interests of nearly  \b \i0 \ul0 [*2]\b0 \i0 \ul0   3 million Hispanic-owned businesses in the United States that generate nearly $ 400 billion in revenue annually. It also serves as the umbrella organization for more than 200 local Hispanic chambers in the United States and Puerto Rico. The USHCC understands the frustration over a broken immigration system, but fears that the enjoined provisions of S.B. 1070, by encouraging racial profiling of Latinos, will jeopardize community safety and the speedy recovery of our economy. The USHCC is particularly concerned about the added burdens that our merchants and entrepreneurs will face in the course of doing business when forced to defend their right to contribute to our society.
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Hispanic National Bar Association ("HBNA")\b0 \i0 \ul0  is a nonprofit, nonpartisan, national professional association that represents the interests of all attorneys, judges, law professors, legal assistants and law students of Hispanic descent in the United States and Puerto Rico. The HNBA has 39 affiliated bars in various states across the country, including Arizona. The HNBA's continuing mission is to improve the study, practice and administration of justice for all Americans by ensuring the meaningful participation of Hispanics in the legal profession. The HNBA has a vested interest in the equal opportunity of Latinos to be free from unlawful discrimination and harassment. Members of the HNBA who practice in Arizona fear that if the enjoined provisions of S.B. 1070 are implemented, it will inhibit them from fully serving clients and vindicating their clients' legal rights. By causing many individuals of Hispanic descent to flee the State, these provisions of S.B. 1070 will cause cases to be delayed, held in abeyance or left unprosecuted,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*3]\b0 \i0 \ul0   thereby denying HNBA's clients a timely adjudication of their claims and rights.
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Los Abogados Hispanic Bar Association ("Los Abogados")\b0 \i0 \ul0  is the Arizona affiliate of HNBA. The primary purposes of Los Abogados are: (1) to enhance the quality of legal services provided to the community; (2) to educate the Hispanic community regarding its rights and remedies, as well as the availability of legal services; (3) to receive and administer funds for the promotion and advancement of the Hispanic legal profession within the State of Arizona; and (4) to aid in gathering, exchanging and disseminating facts and information relating to the business methods within the Hispanic legal profession. Los Abogados has a particular interest in this lawsuit because its members represent Latinos in the State of Arizona whose lives and legal representation are directly affected by the enjoined provisions of S.B. 1070.
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials ("NALEO") Educational Fund\b0 \i0 \ul0  is the leading national nonpartisan organization that facilitates full Latino participation in the American political process, from citizenship to public service. The NALEO Educational Fund achieves its mission through integrated strategies that include increasing the effectiveness of Latino policymakers, mobilizing the Latino community to engage in civic life, and promoting policies that advance Latino civic engagement. The NALEO Educational Fund believes that state legislative measures, such as S.B. 1070, are grounded in discrimination against Latinos, and will perpetuate large-scale discrimination against Latinos and other newcomers.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  \b \i0 \ul0 [*4]\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b \i0 \ul0 INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 S.B. 1070 targets the state's Latino community, which \b \i0 \ul0 [**14]\b0 \i0 \ul0   comprises nearly 30% of Arizona's population. n2 The District Court's preliminary injunction has stayed the implementation of the most egregious sections of that statute. The judgment of the Ninth Circuit, upholding the injunction, should be affirmed for the following reasons:
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0 . \b \i0 \ul0 Lifting the injunction will have a profound chilling effect on the ability of many Latino children to obtain an education.\b0 \i0 \ul0  Should the enjoined provisions of S.B. 1070 be allowed to take effect, many Latino families in Arizona will live under an increased fear that teachers, school administrators and police officers will be compelled to report information to the government that will call into question the immigration status of students and their families. These fears will dissuade affected Latino families from enrolling their children, and will convince some to  \b \i0 \ul0 [*5]\b0 \i0 \ul0   withdraw their children from school altogether.
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0 . \b \i0 \ul0 Allowing the enjoined provisions of the statute to take effect will prevent affected Latinos from applying for federal benefits to which they are entitled and which they may desperately need.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0 . \b \i0 \ul0 Overturning the injunction will lead to increased harassment and violence\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b \i0 \ul0 [**15]\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b \i0 \ul0  against Latinos.\b0 \i0 \ul0  Studies demonstrate that discrimination and hate crimes against immigrants rise sharply when laws with anti-immigrant animus and effect are enacted.
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0 . \b \i0 \ul0 If the enjoined provisions of the law are allowed to take effect, Latinos will face a substantially increased risk of unconstitutional police action.\b0 \i0 \ul0  This concern is heightened by the United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division's recently released report finding "reasonable cause to believe that" the Maricopa County Sheriffs Office already "engages in a pattern or practice of unconstitutional policing" against Latinos. The Justice Department's nearly three-year investigation documented widespread bias. If the enjoined provisions of S.B. 1070 are allowed to take effect, behavior such as that documented by the Justice Department's  \b \i0 \ul0 [*6]\b0 \i0 \ul0   report likely will continue and, indeed, worsen.
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0 . \b \i0 \ul0 Overturning the injunction will harm not only Arizona's Latino-owned businesses, but businesses throughout the state.\b0 \i0 \ul0  A number of businesses have already seen a sharp decline in revenues because many in the Latino community are choosing either to flee the state or to stay at home rather than risk \b \i0 \ul0 [**16]\b0 \i0 \ul0   harassment by police whenever they venture out, such as to go shopping or dine at a restaurant. The impact of this decline has been substantial, and the situation will deteriorate further if the enjoined provisions of the statute are permitted to take effect. Latino immigrants are a substantial contributor to Arizona's economy. One recent report estimated that the purchasing power of Arizona's Latinos totaled $ 33.9 billion in 2010. As a result, vacating the preliminary injunction will severely disrupt Arizona's economy at a time when the state's residents can ill afford it.

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 For these reasons and the reasons stated in Respondent's brief, the Court should uphold the preliminary injunction.
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  \b \i0 \ul0 [*7]\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b \i0 \ul0 ARGUMENT\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 S.B. 1070 is a misguided attempt to append new criminal penalties onto \b \i0 \ul0 [**17]\b0 \i0 \ul0   the federal immigration scheme and create a state immigration program that intrudes into an area of law committed exclusively to the federal government. In developing the federal framework, Congress was mindful of the injurious consequences that would befall immigrants and racial minorities if states and localities intruded into this federal domain. Congress barred states and localities from participating in most aspects of this enforcement scheme and imposed strict anti-discrimination provisions on all aspects of its enforcement. Thus, in deciding whether to overturn the injunction now in place, the Court should be cognizant of what the impact would be on Latinos, regardless of their immigration status. Because this recent surge of state and local anti-immigrant laws has been motivated by anti-Latino bias and has had an unlawful impact on Latinos, n3 the \b0 \i \ul0 amici\b0 \i0 \ul0  herein, five preeminent Latino organizations, present the Court with a description of the impact lifting the injunction would have on Latinos.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Lifting the injunction against Sections 2, 3, 5, and 6 of Arizona's S.B. 1070 (the "Enjoined Provisions") will deprive many Latino children of the ability to obtain an education. n4 Should the Enjoined Provisions  \b \i0 \ul0 [*9]\b0 \i0 \ul0   take effect, many Latino families in Arizona will live under an increased fear that teachers, school administrators and police officers assigned to patrol schools will divulge information to the government regarding the immigration status of students and their families. n5 For example, public schools in Arizona are required to document the residence and educational history of each new student. n6 Latino students who are (or who have family members who are) undocumented or otherwise "removable from the United States" will fear incurring inquiries or penalties under the Enjoined Provisions when they provide required enrollment information. Indeed, if the enrollment  \b \i0 \ul0 [*10]\b0 \i0 \ul0   information reveals that the student once attended a school \b \i0 \ul0 [**19]\b0 \i0 \ul0   outside of the United States, it could be viewed as evidence that the student or someone in her family may be undocumented, which could lead those individuals to be targeted under the Enjoined Provisions.

\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li1200\ri600 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li1200\ri600 \sb0 \fi0 . The provision of Section 2 of S.B. 1070 (Ariz. Rev. Stat, (hereafter "Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.") \'a7 11-1051(B)) that was enjoined is the portion requiring an officer "for any lawful stop, detention or arrest" to make a "reasonable attempt . . . to determine the immigration status of the person, except if the determination may hinder or obstruct an investigation. Any person who is arrested shall have the person's immigration status determined before the person is released."
\par \pard \ql \li1200\ri600 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li1200\ri600 \sb0 \fi0 . Section 3 of S.B. 1070 (Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \'a7 13-1509) creates a crime for the "willful failure to complete or carry an alien registration document."
\par \pard \ql \li1200\ri600 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li1200\ri600 \sb0 \fi0 . The provision of Section 5 of S.B. 1070 (Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \'a7 13-2928(C)) that was enjoined is the portion creating a crime for an unauthorized alien to solicit, apply for, or perform work.
\par \pard \ql \li1200\ri600 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li1200\ri600 \sb0 \fi0 . Section 6 of S.B. 1070 (Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \'a7 13-3883(A)(5)) authorizes the warrantless arrest of a person where there is probable cause to believe the person "has committed any public offense that makes the person removable from the United States."

FERPA prohibits schools from releasing so-called "directory information," which includes the student's place of birth and the last educational institution attended by the student, without the student's consent. See 20 U.S.C. \'a7 1232g(a)(5); 34 C.F.R. \'a7 99.3. Even so, a newly enrolled Latino student's refusal to disclose this information to law enforcement agencies could be viewed as evidence that the student or one of her parents may be in this country without permission.

These fears will dissuade affected Latino families from enrolling their children and will convince some to withdraw their children from school altogether. Arizona schools already trail the national average in graduation rate. n10 Lifting the injunction will thus effectively undermine this Court's ruling in \b0 \i \ul0 Plyler v. Doe,\b0 \i0 \ul0  457 U.S. 202 (1982), in which the Court held that states may not bar children from public schools solely because of their immigration status or that of their parents.

Following passage of S.B. 1070, educators reported that some Latino parents stopped attending parent-teacher conferences and other programs designed to engage parents in their children's education. n13 These educators attributed the decline in parental involvement to fear and mistrust generated by S.B. 1070. n14 If the Enjoined Provisions are allowed to take effect, parents will have additional cause for fear, and a further decrease in attendance can be expected.

The Department of Justice, for example, observed that "MCSO ... has created \b \i0 \ul0 [**53]\b0 \i0 \ul0   a 'wall of distrust' between MCSO officers and Maricopa County's Latino residents - a wall of distrust that has significantly compromised MCSO's ability to provide police protection to Maricopa  \b \i0 \ul0 [*33]\b0 \i0 \ul0   County's Latino residents." n69 This fear and distrust may also explain why, although hate crimes have risen in Arizona, reports of hate crimes against Latinos have dropped: Latinos are afraid to report these crimes because of the exposure associated with doing so. n70 One Pima County high school student explained:
