\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The issue in this case is whether Arizona's S.B. 1070, a comprehensive state immigration law designed to effectuate Arizona's preferred immigration policy of "attrition through enforcement," \b0 \i \ul0 see\b0 \i0 \ul0  \'a7 1, violates the Supremacy Clause.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This brief responds specifically to Petitioners' assertion that state law enforcement officers may enforce the federal immigration laws--both civil and criminal--as provided for in S.B. 1070's stop and arrest provisions, because states have "inherent authority" to enforce federal law as a general matter. Pet. Br. at 23. \b0 \i \ul0 Amici\b0 \i0 \ul0  agree with the United States that S.B. 1070's stop and arrest provisions are preempted,  \b \i0 \ul0 [**11]\b0 \i0 \ul0   but we take a more restrictive view of the  \b \i0 \ul0 [*2]\b0 \i0 \ul0   authority of the states to enforce federal immigration law and provide additional grounds in this brief for finding preemption.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 First, the authority of state officers to perform the functions of federal immigration officers is specifically delineated in the federal immigration statutes. It extends no further and does not include the authority to interrogate, arrest, and detain that Arizona has claimed in S.B. 1070. See \b0 \i \ul0 infra\b0 \i0 \ul0  Part I. Second, whatever "inherent authority" state officers may have to enforce federal law as a general matter does not extend to enforcement of the immigration laws given longstanding precedents from this Court holding that both the establishment of the immigration laws and the manner of their execution are committed solely to federal government. \b0 \i \ul0 See infra\b0 \i0 \ul0  Part II. Although the Court may resolve this case by finding Arizona's law preempted without addressing the precise limits of state authority in the immigration context, \b0 \i \ul0 amici\b0 \i0 \ul0  offer these arguments in further support of that conclusion.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This Court has long recognized the special need, expressed in the Constitution, for uniformity and federal \b \i0 \ul0 [**12]\b0 \i0 \ul0   supremacy in the immigration area. The federal government's exclusive immigration power extends not only to the entry and admission of noncitizens, but also to the conditions under which they may remain and determinations about whether and when they should be removed from the United States--including the determination whether to investigate, arrest, and detain a noncitizen for the purpose of removing him from the United States. Because these immigration powers arise from the sovereign authority of the United States, they are not  \b \i0 \ul0 [*3]\b0 \i0 \ul0   part of the states' police powers. Arizona's claim--that a general and "inherent authority" of states to enforce federal law applies with equal force in the immigration context--must therefore be rejected.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Even if it were true that states would otherwise have some "inherent authority" concerning immigration matters, Arizona ignores the touchstone of preemption analysis: congressional intent. Congress has acted to preclude state authority to engage in the immigration enforcement activities authorized under S.B. 1070's stop and arrest provisions. Those sections of S.B. 1070 also conflict fundamentally with Congress's comprehensive and detailed scheme \b \i0 \ul0 [**13]\b0 \i0 \ul0   regulating the status, presence, arrest, detention, and removal of noncitizens. Arizona's grant of authority to its officers to interrogate, arrest, and detain noncitizens for immigration purposes violates the Supremacy Clause because it intrudes on a field that Congress has occupied and because it conflicts with federal law. \b0 \i \ul0 See, e.g., \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 DeCanas v. Bica,\b0 \i0 \ul0  424 U.S. 351, 356, 363 (1976) (setting out field and conflict preemption standards); \b0 \i \ul0 see also \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Crosby v. Nat'l Foreign Trade Council,\b0 \i0 \ul0  530 U.S. 363, 373 n.6 (2000) (explaining that the "categories of preemption are not 'rigidly distinct'") (citation omitted).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In the Immigration and Nationality Act ("INA"), Congress has assigned authority over immigration interrogation, arrest, and detention to the federal government. Moreover, Congress has specifically authorized state law enforcement officers to perform these functions in only four narrow and limited circumstances. Congress's decision to provide such authority in four circumstances and no others  \b \i0 \ul0 [*4]\b0 \i0 \ul0   demonstrates that Congress deliberately considered and rejected the notion that state officers should have independent authority to investigate, arrest,  \b \i0 \ul0 [**14]\b0 \i0 \ul0   and detain for immigration purposes. Other provisions in the INA concerning communications and "cooperation" with the federal government, \b0 \i \ul0 see\b0 \i0 \ul0  8 U.S.C. \'a7\'a7 1357(g)(10), 1373(c), 1644, provide no support for Arizona's claim of "inherent authority." By their express terms, and contrary to any suggestion by the parties, those federal statutes do not grant state or local officers any immigration enforcement authority. To read these provisions otherwise would render superfluous Congress's express, but limited, authorization for state and local enforcement.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Arizona's grant of authority to its officers is also inconsistent with Congress's basic delegation of power to the Executive Branch and the overall operation and structure of the INA. The scheme created by Congress delegates discretion to the Executive Branch to decide when to investigate, arrest, detain, and remove noncitizens from the United States--and when to forbear. Unlike the Arizona scheme embodied by S.B. 1070's stop and arrest provisions, the federal statutory scheme does not provide for the removal of every noncitizen without a lawful immigration status; rather, the immigration statutes provide alternatives \b \i0 \ul0 [**15]\b0 \i0 \ul0   that leave to the Executive Branch the decision whether such persons should (or in some cases must) be permitted to remain, either temporarily or permanently. In contrast, Arizona has empowered its officers to arrest, interrogate, and detain noncitizens independent of federal determinations, including noncitizens who are not lawfully present but are  \b \i0 \ul0 [*5]\b0 \i0 \ul0   nonetheless permitted under the immigration laws to remain in the United States. Arizona seeks to override these aspects of federal immigration law and to take into its own hands the decision whether to detain a particular noncitizen.
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ARIZONA'S STATUTORY SCHEME\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 S.B. 1070 is an integrated set of state immigration regulations that establish new state immigration crimes and law enforcement mandates. See Arizona Senate Bill ("S.B.") 1070, 49th Leg., 2nd Reg. Sess., Ch. 113 (Az. 2010), as amended by Arizona House Bill ("H.B.") 2162, 49th Leg., 2nd Reg. Sess., Ch. 211 (Az. 2010). At issue in this case are four specific provisions of Arizona's immigration law: a provision making it a state law crime for noncitizens to fail to register with the federal government (Ariz. S.B. 1070 \'a7 3; Arizona Revised Statute ("A.R.S.") \'a7 13-1509(A));  \b \i0 \ul0 [**16]\b0 \i0 \ul0   a provision making it a state law crime for noncitizens to engage in unauthorized work (S.B. 1070, \'a7 5(C); A.R.S. \'a7 13-2928(C)); and the two stop and arrest provisions, authorizing state and local officers to investigate, detain, and arrest individuals for immigration purposes (\'a7\'a7 2(B) and 6, A.R.S. \'a7\'a7 11-1051(B), 13-3883(A)(5)).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This state immigration scheme purports to grant state and local officers independent authority to investigate, arrest, detain, and punish noncitizens who are deemed to be without legal authorization to remain in the United States. n2 Specifically, S.B. 1070  \b \i0 \ul0 [*6]\b0 \i0 \ul0   empowers state and local law enforcement officers to exercise core immigration enforcement functions, making immigration-based investigation, arrest, and detention decisions without any federal supervision. Section 2(B) directs that any police officer who has conducted a "lawful stop, detention or arrest . . . in the enforcement of any other law or ordinance of a county, city or town or [the State of Arizona]" \b0 \i \ul0 must\b0 \i0 \ul0  make a "reasonable attempt" to determine the  \b \i0 \ul0 [*7]\b0 \i0 \ul0   immigration status of the person who has been stopped, detained, or arrested, whenever "reasonable suspicion exists that \b \i0 \ul0 [**17]\b0 \i0 \ul0   the person is an alien and is unlawfully present." Ariz. S.B. 1070 \'a7 2(B). Prior to releasing any person who has been arrested, officers must determine the person's immigration status and must detain the arrested person until such status is verified, regardless of whether any state charges are pending and whether the federal government has requested detention. \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  Section 2(B) places no limit on the length of time that individuals may be detained while their immigration or citizenship status is being determined.
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 n2 Since the enactment of S.B. 1070, five other states have followed Arizona's lead by passing state immigration schemes targeting persons based on immigration status, including provisions allowing or requiring local law enforcement officials to investigate immigration status during stops and to make warrantless arrests based on suspicion of immigration offenses. Substantial parts of these state laws have been enjoined. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  Ala. H.B. 56, 2011 Leg., Reg. Sess. (2011); Ga. H.B. 87, 2011-12 Leg., Reg. Sess. (2011); Ind. S. Enrolled Act 590, 117th Gen. Assemb., 1st Reg. Sess. (2011); S.C. Act 69, 2011-12 Gen. Assemb., 119th Sess. (2011); Utah H.B. 497, Leg., 2011 Gen. Sess. (2011); \b0 \i \ul0 see also Hispanic Interest Coal. of Ala. v. Bentley,\b0 \i0 \ul0  5:ll-CV-2484-SLB, 2011 WL 5516953 (N.D. Ala. Sept. 28, 2011); \b0 \i \ul0 United States v. Alabama,\b0 \i0 \ul0      F. Supp. 2d    , 2011 WL 4469941 (N.D. Ala. Sep. 28, 2011) (appeal pending, 11th Cir. No. 11-14532-CC); \b0 \i \ul0 Ga. Latino Alliance for Human Rights v. Deal\b0 \i0 \ul0  ("\b0 \i \ul0 GLAHR\b0 \i0 \ul0 "), 793 F. Supp. 2d 1317 (N.D. Ga. 2011) (appeal pending, 11th Cir. No. 11-13044-C); \b0 \i \ul0 United States v. South Carolina,\b0 \i0 \ul0      F. Supp. 2d    , 2011 WL 6973241 (D.S.C. Dec. 22, 2011) (appeal pending, 4th Cir. No. 12-1096); \b0 \i \ul0 Utah Coal. of La Raza v. Herbert,\b0 \i0 \ul0  No.11-cv-00401 (D. Utah); \b0 \i \ul0 Buquer v. City of Indianapolis,\b0 \i0 \ul0  No. 11-cv-00708 SEB-MJD (S.D. Ind. 2011). These state laws also include provisions not at issue in this case. For example, Alabama's law, parts of which are enjoined, has provisions requiring school officials to inquire into and to report information about the birthplace of children enrolling in public elementary and secondary schools, and the immigration status of their parents; making it a felony for persons deemed not lawfully present to attempt to engage in any transaction with the state government; and rendering unenforceable any contract where one party knows or has reason to know that the other party is not lawfully present in the United States. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  Ala. H.B. 56 \'a7\'a7 27, 28, 30.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  \b \i0 \ul0 [**18]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Section 6 provides that "[a] peace officer, without a warrant, may arrest a person if the officer has probable cause to believe . . . [t]he person to be arrested has committed any public offense that makes the person removable from the United States." S.B. 1070, \'a7 6; A.R.S. \'a7 13-3883(A)(5). Because no federal law criminalizes removability by itself, \'a7 6 effectively authorizes warrantless arrests by state officers for behavior that is a civil offense under federal law. n3
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 n3 Section 1325 of Title 8 criminalizes the offense of illegal entry, and \'a7 1326 criminalizes re-entry after removal, but neither criminalizes removability or illegal presence without more. 8 U.S.C. \'a7\'a7 1325, 1326; \b0 \i \ul0 see also\b0 \i0 \ul0  Resp. Br. at 3, 31-32. This distinction is of great legal and practical importance. For example, a person may enter the United States lawfully on a tourist visa, but then remain beyond the authorized time period. Such a person would be unlawfully present in the country and therefore removable without having unlawfully entered, and would not be subject to any criminal charge due to the visa overstay.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360  \b \i0 \ul0 [*8]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Arizona contends that \'a7\'a7 2(B) and 6 are valid \b \i0 \ul0 [**19]\b0 \i0 \ul0   because state and local officers have "inherent authority" to make arrests for all federal offenses, including immigration violations both criminal and civil. Pet. Br. at 23, 42. Arizona further contends that, in light of that "inherent authority," what the federal immigration laws do or do not provide "is beside the point." \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 23. Arizona suggests that certain provisions of the INA concerning communications and limited "cooperation" with the federal government "[e]xpressly [a]uthorize[]" the unilateral enforcement functions provided for in \'a7\'a7 2(B) and 6. Pet. Br. at 31.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 As shown below, the Ninth Circuit correctly rejected Arizona's arguments and held that the United States was substantially likely to prevail on its claim that \'a7\'a7 2(B) and 6 are preempted. See \b0 \i \ul0 Ariz.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  641 F.3d at 348-54, 360-66.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 I. The State Enforcement Authority Claimed by Arizona is Fundamentally at Odds with the Immigration Laws Enacted By Congress\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 We begin with the statutes that Congress has enacted. Arizona claims that \'a7\'a7 2(B) and 6 are justified by the "inherent authority" of its officers to enforce federal laws generally, but this argument fails to \b \i0 \ul0 [**20]\b0 \i0 \ul0   account for the specific statutory scheme that Congress has enacted in the immigration context. Whatever authority states might have in the absence of federal legislation, there can be no doubt that Congress has spoken. As shown below, \'a7\'a7 2(B) and 6 are preempted by the INA's comprehensive and detailed immigration enforcement scheme.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Arizona's assertion of "inherent authority" to enforce federal immigration laws is directly at odds with the comprehensive enforcement scheme Congress has legislated in the INA. That federal scheme (1) delegates power to investigate, arrest, and detain for immigration purposes to the Attorney General and to \b0 \i \ul0 federal\b0 \i0 \ul0  immigration officers, and (2) specifies when state or local officers may perform these immigration officer functions through four limited authorizations. Sections 2(B) and 6 of S.B. 1070 go far beyond the limits \b \i0 \ul0 [**21]\b0 \i0 \ul0   set by Congress and are therefore preempted.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Congress has delegated authority over and responsibility for the enforcement of the immigration laws to the Executive Branch. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  8 U.S.C. \'a7 1103(a)(1) ("The Secretary of Homeland Security shall be charged with the administration and enforcement of this chapter and all other laws relating to the immigration and naturalization of aliens[.]"); \b0 \i \ul0 id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at \'a7 1103(g) (granting the Attorney General authority to issue regulations and instructions necessary to carry out congressional goals on immigration enforcement).

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Critically, Congress also has specifically addressed whether and when, under the complex immigration scheme it has established, state and local officers may have authority to perform the functions of an immigration officer, including specifically interrogation, arrest, and detention for immigration purposes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 First, 8 U.S.C. \'a7 1324(c) authorizes state and local officers to make arrests for the federal immigration crimes of transporting, smuggling, or harboring certain aliens. \b0 \i \ul0 See id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  (authorizing "arrests" by "all . . . officers whose duty it is to enforce criminal laws").
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360  \b \i0 \ul0 [*12]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Second, under 8 U.S.C. \'a7 1252c, "State and local law enforcement officials" may arrest and detain a noncitizen for the federal crime of illegal reentry into the United States by a deported felon, but only if the federal government provides "appropriate confirmation" of the suspect's status, and if the detention is only for such time as may be required for the federal government to take the individual into custody.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Third, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \'a7 1103(a)(10), the Attorney General may authorize "any State or local enforcement officer"  \b \i0 \ul0 [**25]\b0 \i0 \ul0   to enforce immigration laws upon certification of "an actual or imminent mass influx of aliens." Unlike \'a7\'a7 1324(c) and 1252c, this provision allows the Attorney General to confer upon local officials the powers granted to federal immigration officers, but only in an extremely narrow circumstance that has never been invoked in the history of our Nation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Fourth, the detailed provisions of 8 U.S.C. \'a7 1357(g), entitled "Performance of immigration officer functions by State officers and employees," permit state officers to perform certain functions of immigration officers if the Attorney General enters into a written agreement with the state or local government that satisfies specific conditions. Section 1357(g) follows \'a7\'a7 1357(a)-(f) which, as discussed above, set forth specifically the authority of federal immigration officers to interrogate, arrest, and perform other immigration officer functions under certain circumstances. If the statutory requirements of subsection (g) are met, state or local officers designated by the Attorney General may perform, even in the absence of a mass influx, any "function of  \b \i0 \ul0 [*13]\b0 \i0 \ul0   an immigration officer in relation to the investigation,  \b \i0 \ul0 [**26]\b0 \i0 \ul0   apprehension, or detention of aliens in the United States." 8 U.S.C. \'a7 1357(g)(1). Section 1357(g) thus reinforces that, under the INA, "investigation, apprehension, or detention of aliens in the United States"-the functions Arizona empowers its officers to undertake in \'a7 2(B) and 6-are "function[s] of an immigration officer" delegated to federal agents or, with a written agreement and subject to \'a7 1357(g)'s other requirements, to designated state officers. \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Under \'a7 1357(g) the state officers "shall be subject to the direction and supervision of the Attorney General" when performing these immigration officer functions pursuant to written agreement. \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at \'a7 1357(g)(3). Section 1357(g) also requires that the "written agreement" explicitly set forth "the specific powers and duties that may be, or are required to be, exercised or performed by the individual [officer], the duration of the authority of the individual, and the position of the agency of the Attorney General who is required to supervise and direct the individual." \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at \'a7 1357(g)(5).

Taken together, the broad delegation of "immigration officer" functions to federal agents and the very narrow authorizations of such functions for state or local officers fully occupy the field as to the power to arrest, detain and investigate for immigration purposes.

The United States suggests that \'a7 1357(g)(10) grants authority for state officers to cooperate with the federal government in immigration enforcement in a manner consistent with federal immigration directives and priorities. Resp. Br. at 7, 45-46. Neither construction is supported by the language of \'a7 1357 or its overall structure.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 By its plain terms, and read in light of the other subsections of \'a7 1357 and in the context of the overall structure of the INA, \'a7 1357(g)(10) is not an affirmative grant of authority. See, \b0 \i \ul0 e.g., \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Harris Trust & Sav.  \b \i0 \ul0 [*19]\b0 \i \ul0   Bank,\b0 \i0 \ul0  510 U.S. 86, 94-95 (1993) (stating that in construing statutory text, the Court is "guided not by a 'single sentence or member of a sentence, but look[s] to the provisions of the whole law, and to its object and policy'")  \b \i0 \ul0 [**34]\b0 \i0 \ul0   (citation omitted). As discussed \b0 \i \ul0 supra,\b0 \i0 \ul0  the provisions of \'a7\'a7 1357(a)-(f) carefully delineate the powers of immigration officers and the limits on those powers. Section 1357(g) then provides a mechanism, pursuant to written agreement, for state officers to "perform a function of an immigration officer in relation to the investigation, apprehension, or detention of aliens." \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at \'a7 1357(g)(1) (emphasis added). The only reading of \'a7 1357(g)(10) consistent with the INA's specific provisions regarding enforcement by state officers in \'a7 1357 and elsewhere in the statute (as discussed above) is that Congress wanted to make clear that the authorization in \'a7 1357(g) for written agreements empowering state and local officers to perform immigration officer functions did not create a new prerequisite for all otherwise-authorized forms of "cooperat[ion]" (or "immigration status" communication). Thus, for example, \'a7 1357(g)(10) makes clear that no agreement is necessary for state and local officers to exercise the authority in \'a7 1252c or \'a7 1324(c). If \'a7 1357(g)(10)(B) were read (contrary to its text) as an affirmative grant of authority, then the INA provisions expressly authorizing \b \i0 \ul0 [**35]\b0 \i0 \ul0   state immigration enforcement activities would be rendered superfluous. \b0 \i \ul0 See \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 United States v. Arizona,\b0 \i0 \ul0  641 F.3d 339, 365 (9th Cir. 2011).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Finally, even assuming that \'a7 1357(g)(10) contained an affirmative grant of authority to state officers, the authority granted in \'a7\'a7 2(B) and 6 can in no way be considered to be "cooperat[ive]" because, as  \b \i0 \ul0 [*20]\b0 \i0 \ul0   the United States explains, it allows Arizona officers to enforce the federal immigration laws without regard for the Executive Branch discretion provided for by Congress and reflected in the immigration laws.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Arizona's reliance on 8 U.S.C. \'a7\'a7 1373 and 1644 also fails. Neither of those statutes provides support for the notion that states have authority to investigate, arrest, or detain for immigration purposes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Section 1644 bars federal and state actors from "prohibit[ing], or in any way restrict[ing]," any government entity, "from sending to or receiving from the Immigration and Naturalization Service information \b \i0 \ul0 [**36]\b0 \i0 \ul0   regarding the immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of an alien in the United States." 8 U.S.C. \'a7 1644. Section 1373 contains nearly identical information sharing provisions, \b0 \i \ul0 see id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at \'a7 1373(a), and also requires federal immigration officials to respond to inquiries by governmental agencies "seeking to verify or ascertain the citizenship or immigration status of any individual within the jurisdiction of the agency for any purpose authorized by law." 8 U.S.C. \'a7 1373(c). Sections 1644 and 1373 thus facilitate communication between the federal government and state or local officials, but neither grants the states any authority to detain, arrest, or even to investigate immigration status.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The backdrop against which \'a7 1644 was enacted confirms that Congress's intent was to  \b \i0 \ul0 [*21]\b0 \i0 \ul0   facilitate information sharing, but only for authorized activities. Congress enacted \'a7 1644 as part of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 ("PRWORA"), Pub. L. No. 104-193, 110 Stat 2105 (1996), which established restrictions on public benefits for noncitizens. See 8 U.S.C. \'a7\'a7 1621 \b \i0 \ul0 [**37]\b0 \i0 \ul0   -22 (setting forth state authority to grant or deny state and local public benefits to noncitizens). Section 1644 furthers the operation of those provisions by facilitating states' access to the immigration-related information needed to determine eligibility for benefits - a purpose independently authorized by law.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 While \'a7 1373 requires the federal government to respond to certain immigration status inquiries, it does not grant any power to state or local officials to arrest, detain or investigate for immigration purposes. Rather, as noted, the statute requires federal officials to respond to immigration status inquiries if made for a purpose "authorized by law." 8 U.S.C. \'a7 1373(c).

Br. at 18-21 (citing statutory examples). Arizona's grant of enforcement authority to its own officers in \'a7\'a7 2(B) and 6 attempts to supplant that discretion. In particular, under Congress's statutory scheme, the Executive is authorized to exercise discretion in determining whether to initiate enforcement action against any noncitizen. See, \b0 \i \ul0 e.g., \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Reno v.

Chaney,\b0 \i0 \ul0  470 U.S. 821, 831 (1985). The many INA provisions granting discretion to the Executive reflect Congress's intent that the federal government must balance important national objectives in enforcing the immigration laws, weighing the desire to remove or to detain an alien against countervailing interests, including humanitarian concerns, sensitive \b \i0 \ul0 [**41]\b0 \i0 \ul0   foreign relations considerations,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*24]\b0 \i0 \ul0   and special individualized circumstances.

In addition, many persons who currently lack immigration status, including those who have \b \i0 \ul0 [**42]\b0 \i0 \ul0   already been found by an immigration judge to be removable, may be permitted by the Executive to remain in the United States, even indefinitely. \b0 \i \ul0 See, e.g.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  8 U.S.C. \'a7\'a7 1229b, 1229b(b)(2) (cancellation of removal); \b0 \i \ul0 id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at \'a7 1158 (political asylum); \b0 \i \ul0 id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at \'a7 1255(m) (adjustment of status pursuant to Violence Against Women Act); \b0 \i \ul0 id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at \'a7 1255(i) (adjustment of status for certain unlawful entrants); \b0 \i \ul0 id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at \'a7 1254a (temporary protected status). \b0 \i \ul0 See also\b0 \i0 \ul0  Resp.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In enacting the complex immigration scheme discussed above, Congress was exercising its exclusive authority to regulate immigration. Under the Constitution, "[c]ontrol over immigration and naturalization is entrusted exclusively to the Federal Government, and a State has no power to interfere." \b0 \i \ul0 Nyquist v. Mauclet,\b0 \i0 \ul0  432 U.S. 1, 10 (1977). The federal government's exclusive authority to regulate immigration--reflecting the special need for uniformity and federal supremacy--demonstrates that any general criminal law concepts of concurrent jurisdiction \b \i0 \ul0 [**45]\b0 \i0 \ul0   or "inherent authority" have no application in the immigration context.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 As set forth below, Arizona's claimed "inherent authority" to investigate, detain and arrest people on the basis of civil immigration violations is not supported by any authorities. And Petitioners' contention is fundamentally inconsistent with the federal government's sovereign power to determine which noncitizens will be permitted to stay in the country and the conditions under which they will be allowed to remain.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Arizona's claim that "state law enforcement officers have inherent authority . . . to investigate and arrest for violations of federal law" is not supported by the authorities it cites. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  Pet. Br. at 42-43 (citing \b0 \i \ul0 In Re Quarles,\b0 \i0 \ul0  158 U.S. 532, 535 (1895), \b0 \i \ul0 United States v. Di Re,\b0 \i0 \ul0  332 U.S. 581 (1948), and \b0 \i \ul0 Marsh v. United States,\b0 \i0 \ul0  29 F.2d 172, 174 (2d Cir. 1928)).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 None of the three cases concerns enforcement of civil laws and, critically, they do not involve immigration, which has special constitutional status as an area of exclusive federal \b \i0 \ul0 [**46]\b0 \i0 \ul0   concern. This Court has previously recognized that where special federal concerns are at stake, state or local officers lack authority to arrest for federal offenses. For example, in \b0 \i \ul0 Kurtz v. Moffitt,\b0 \i0 \ul0  115 U.S. 487 (1885), this Court held that a local police officer had no authority to arrest or detain a deserter from the United States Army. \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 505. The Court examined the particular context of military law and reasoned that Congress had never conferred on state or local law enforcement officers any power over persons punishable for military offenses. \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 500.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Moreover, the cases cited by the Petitioners do not even establish that state or local officers have general authority to enforce all federal laws. \b0 \i \ul0 Quarles\b0 \i0 \ul0  concerned the question whether a \b0 \i \ul0 federal\b0 \i0 \ul0  deputy . marshal could enforce certain provisions of the federal internal revenue code, 158 U.S. at 537, and accordingly, the Court had no occasion to decide  \b \i0 \ul0 [*28]\b0 \i0 \ul0   whether a state or local officer could make arrests for violations of federal law.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In \b0 \i \ul0 Di Re,\b0 \i0 \ul0  although the Court did consider the validity of a criminal arrest made by a local police officer,  \b \i0 \ul0 [**47]\b0 \i0 \ul0   332 U.S. at 583, the opinion does not support the notion that state officers have inherent authority to make arrests for violations of federal law. From the opinion it appears that the defendant, charged with a federal crime, challenged his arrest only on the ground that it was not authorized under state law, \b0 \i \ul0 id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 588-89, and not on the ground that the state officer had no authority to make the arrest under federal law. \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 332 U.S. at 589. Because federal law did not shed light on whether the warrantless arrest was proper, the Court held that "in absence of an applicable federal statute the law of the state where an arrest without warrant takes place determines its validity," \b0 \i \ul0 id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 589, and based on state law, declined to uphold the arrest by the state officer. \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 595. \b0 \i \ul0 Di Re\b0 \i0 \ul0  therefore sheds no light on the scope of state authority at issue here.
\par \b0 \i \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Marsh\b0 \i0 \ul0  is likewise inapposite. \b0 \i \ul0 Marsh\b0 \i0 \ul0  concerned an arrest by a state trooper for violation of the federal Prohibition law. 29 F.2d at 172-74. Judge Hand held that no "implication [could be made] from the powers of arrest given \b \i0 \ul0 [**48]\b0 \i0 \ul0   to [federal] prohibition officers under . . . the National Prohibition Law" that state officers lacked arrest authority, because the Eighteenth Amendment explicitly gave the states concurrent jurisdiction in the area. \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 174. Thus, Judge Hand's statement about the authority of state officers to assist in federal enforcement was specific to the Prohibition context:

The purpose of such a system was to secure obedience as far as possible; it cannot be supposed that, within a state which has no independent system of her own, such co-operation as she does extend must be rejected.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Consistent with this special need for uniformity, "[t]he Federal Government [possesses] broad constitutional powers in determining what aliens shall be admitted to the United States, the period they may remain, regulation of their conduct before naturalization, and the terms and conditions of their naturalization." \b0 \i \ul0 Takahashi v. Fish & Game Comm'n,\b0 \i0 \ul0  334 U.S. 410, 419 (1948). See \b0 \i \ul0 also, e.g., \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 DeCanas,\b0 \i0 \ul0  424 U.S. at 355 (describing "a regulation of immigration" as "essentially a determination of who should or should not be admitted into the country, and the conditions under which a legal entrant may remain."). n14 Both the establishment of substantive immigration laws \b0 \i \ul0 and\b0 \i0 \ul0  the responsibility "for the manner of their execution, belong[] solely to the national government." \b0 \i \ul0 Chy Lung v. Freeman,\b0 \i0 \ul0  92 U.S. 275, 280  \b \i0 \ul0 [*33]\b0 \i0 \ul0   (1875). In contrast, "[u]nder the Constitution the states are granted no such powers." \b0 \i \ul0 Takahashi,\b0 \i0 \ul0  334 U.S. at 419. States enjoy no power to deny aliens "entrance and abode," \b0 \i \ul0 Truax,\b0 \i0 \ul0  239 U.S. at 42, and "no power with respect to the classification of aliens," \b0 \i \ul0 Plyler v. Doe,\b0 \i0 \ul0  457 U.S. 202, 225 (1982). \b \i0 \ul0 [**54]\b0 \i0 \ul0   States "can neither \b0 \i \ul0 add to\b0 \i0 \ul0  nor \b0 \i \ul0 take from\b0 \i0 \ul0  the conditions lawfully imposed by Congress upon admission, naturalization and residence of aliens in the United States or the several states." \b0 \i \ul0 Toll,\b0 \i0 \ul0  458 U.S. at 11 (emphasis added) (quoting \b0 \i \ul0 Takahashi,\b0 \i0 \ul0  334 U.S. at 419). Thus, the federal government's exclusive power includes not only power over entry and admission, but also power over the decisions whether and when to remove a noncitizen and relatedly, whether to initiate immigration enforcement action against a particular individual.

\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 n14 As these cases demonstrate, this Court has described various aspects of the federal government's immigration authority in various ways, in different contexts.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Accordingly, this Court struck down state attempts to regulate immigration as impermissible intrusions on the Nation's sovereignty, even \b \i0 \ul0 [**55]\b0 \i0 \ul0   before Congress enacted a comprehensive, affirmative national immigration policy. \b0 \i \ul0 See \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Henderson v. Mayor of New York,\b0 \i0 \ul0  92 U.S. 259, 273-75 (1875) (voiding a New York law which required vessel owners to post a bond for each landing foreign passenger); \b0 \i \ul0 Chy Lung,\b0 \i0 \ul0  92 U.S. at 280-81 (striking down a California statute requiring vessel owners to pay a bond for certain classes of arriving passengers); \b0 \i \ul0 see also \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Passenger Cases,\b0 \i0 \ul0  48 U.S. at 283 (holding unconstitutional New York and Massachusetts laws that imposed head taxes on landing foreign persons likely to become public charges). These cases decided in the Nation's first century establish that even absent any federal immigration regulation, states would have no authority to regulate immigration. \b0 \i \ul0 See generally  \b \i0 \ul0 [*34]\b0 \i \ul0   \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Padilla v. Kentucky,\b0 \i0 \ul0  130 S. Ct. 1473, 1478 (2010) ("The Nation's first 100 years was 'a period of unimpeded immigration,' . . . It was not until 1875 that Congress first passed a statute barring convicts and prostitutes from entering the country") (internal citations omitted).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Because the immigration power vested exclusively in the federal government is \b \i0 \ul0 [**56]\b0 \i0 \ul0   an inherent attribute of sovereignty, the states cannot turn to their general police power to allow them to enforce the immigration laws. The power to investigate, arrest, and detain for a civil immigration offense is an integral part of the federal government's exclusive sovereign power to remove, and as such, does not fit into well-established notions of state police power. As this Court made clear in \b0 \i \ul0 Henderson,\b0 \i0 \ul0  "whatever may be the nature and extent of that power, where not otherwise restricted, no definition of it, and no urgency for its use, can authorize a State to exercise it in regard to a subject-matter which has been confided exclusively to the discretion of Congress by the Constitution." 92 U.S. at 271. \b0 \i \ul0 See also \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 271-72 ("[W]henever the statute of a State invades the domain of legislation which belongs exclusively to the Congress of the United States, it is void, no matter under what class of powers it may fall, or how closely allied to powers conceded to belong to the States."); \b0 \i \ul0 Passenger Cases,\b0 \i0 \ul0  48 U.S. (7 How.) at 410-12 (Wayne, J.). Thus, the rationale advanced by Arizona--that it needs to protect itself from \b \i0 \ul0 [**57]\b0 \i0 \ul0   purported social costs related to immigration (Pet. Br. at 2-8)--cannot justify the intrusion on the exclusive federal immigration power worked by Sections 2(B) and 6.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360  \b \i0 \ul0 [*35]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Indeed, the federal government's sovereign power over foreign affairs and immigration was not "carved from the mass of state powers" as were many of the other powers reserved for the federal government. \b0 \i \ul0 Curtiss-Wright Exp. Corp.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  299 U.S. at 316. Rather, the states individually have "never possessed international powers." \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  Because the federal government's sovereign power over the entire realm of foreign affairs passed from Great Britain to the colonies "in their collective and corporate capacity as the United States of America." \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  Arizona cannot rely upon its police powers to justify the authority it seeks to grant to its officers to investigate, arrest, and detain for immigration purposes.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The American Civil Liberties Union\b0 \i0 \ul0  ("ACLU") is a nationwide, nonprofit, nonpartisan organization of more than 500,000 members dedicated to protecting the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution and the laws of the United States. The ACLU of Arizona is a \b \i0 \ul0 [**60]\b0 \i0 \ul0   state affiliate of the national ACLU. The ACLU has appeared before this Court in numerous cases involving the rights of noncitizens, including \b0 \i \ul0 INS v. St. Cyr,\b0 \i0 \ul0  533 U.S. 289 (2001). The ACLU has also litigated numerous cases involving federal preemption of state and local immigration-related laws, including challenges against state laws recently enacted in Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, South Carolina, and Utah, in addition to Arizona's law, as well as municipal laws enacted in Hazleton, Pennsylvania and Farmers Branch, Texas.
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund\b0 \i0 \ul0  ("MALDEF") is a national civil rights organization established in 1968. Its principal objective is to promote the civil rights of Latinos living in the United States through litigation, advocacy and education. MALDEF has represented Latino and minority interests in civil rights cases in the federal courts throughout the nation, including the Supreme Court. MALDEF's  \b \i0 \ul0 [*2a]\b0 \i0 \ul0   mission includes a commitment to protect the rights of immigrant Latinos in the United States. MALDEF has brought constitutional challenges to attempts by states and localities to engage in the regulation of immigration \b \i0 \ul0 [**61]\b0 \i0 \ul0   in multiple jurisdictions throughout the country, including in Arizona, Alabama, Indiana, South Carolina, Nebraska, California and Texas.
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The National Immigration Law\b0 \i0 \ul0  Center ("NILC") is a nonprofit legal advocacy organization dedicated to advancing and promoting the rights of low-income immigrants and their family members. NILC uses multiple strategies to carry out this mission, including impact litigation, policy advocacy and education, and trainings and technical assistance. A major concern of the organization over the past six years has been the enactment of state laws that seek to regulate immigration and particularly threaten low-income immigrants. Accordingly, NILC is co-lead counsel in class action litigation challenging Arizona S.B. 1070. That case, \b0 \i \ul0 Friendly House v. Whiting,\b0 \i0 \ul0  raises preemption challenges advanced in the instant case as well as additional legal challenges to S.B. 1070. NILC is also co-lead counsel in class action litigation challenging similarly sweeping state immigration enforcement schemes in Utah, Georgia, Alabama, and South Carolina. NILC has a direct interest in the issues in this case.

AAJC is committed to defending the rights of all Americans, particularly underserved populations such as immigrants, communities of color, and other minorities, whom Arizona's S.B. 1070 threatens. AAJC believes that any state's attempt to create its own set of immigration laws interferes with federal power and authority over immigration matters and is unconstitutional.

APALC provides direct legal services and uses impact litigation, public advocacy, and community education to obtain, safeguard, and \b \i0 \ul0 [**63]\b0 \i0 \ul0   improve the civil rights of the Asian Pacific Islander community. APALC serves 15,000 individuals and organizations each year through direct services, outreach, training, and technical assistance. Its primary areas of work include workers' rights, anti-discrimination, immigrant welfare, immigration and citizenship, voting rights, and hate crimes. APALC advocates for the full and equal integration of immigrant communities in a variety of contexts and focuses particularly on the needs of Asian and Pacific Islander immigrants.

It has 38 member organizations  \b \i0 \ul0 [*4a]\b0 \i0 \ul0   throughout the country, including two in Arizona, and it advocates for the interests of day laborers, many of whom are immigrant workers, in matters of national concern. NDLON fosters safer, more humane environments for day laborers and migrant workers to earn a living, contribute to society, and integrate into the community. It also works to unify and strengthen its member organizations to be more strategic and effective in their efforts to develop leadership, mobilize,  \b \i0 \ul0 [**64]\b0 \i0 \ul0   and organize to protect and expand day laborers' civil, labor and human rights. As an organization composed of predominantly immigrant workers, NDLON has long been involved in efforts to monitor the enforcement of immigration law by state and local police, and has a special interest in the question of state and local authority to enforce immigration law.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Asian Chamber of Commerce of Arizona\b0 \i0 \ul0  ("ACC") is an association of Asian-owned businesses whose clientele will be reluctant to shop or visit their establishments out of fear of being stopped, questioned, or asked to show papers by police if S.B. 1070 goes into effect. ACC members  \b \i0 \ul0 [*5a]\b0 \i0 \ul0   and employees include U.S. citizens and noncitizens, individuals born \b \i0 \ul0 [**65]\b0 \i0 \ul0   in the U.S. and recent immigrants, monolingual non-English speakers, limited English-proficient speakers, and individuals who speak English with an accent. ACC has diverted its resources to address the considerable confusion and fear surrounding S.B. 1070 among its members.
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Border Action Network\b0 \i0 \ul0  ("BAN") is a statewide membership organization devoted to protecting the human rights and dignity of immigrant and border communities. BAN builds the political and social capacity of its constituency through grassroots organizing, leadership development, policy advocacy, and educational activities. BAN has over 1,000 members distributed across 6 Arizona counties. The great majority of BAN's membership is Latino. BAN has some members who do not have permission to work or remain in the United States, while other BAN members are legal residents or U.S. citizens, and some live in families of mixed immigration status and nationality. BAN is concerned that its members will be stopped, detained, or arrested under S.B. 1070 due to their appearance or lack of acceptable documents if the law is allowed to take effect, and BAN's own mission would be frustrated by S.B. 1070. BAN's staff frequently \b \i0 \ul0 [**66]\b0 \i0 \ul0   buses members to events and organizational functions without regard to their passengers' "immigration status," and they are concerned that this could subject them to prosecution under S.B. 1070. In addition, BAN has had to divert significant resources to a public education campaign to inform its members about their rights and responsibilities under the new law and address their fears and concerns. Finally, some of BAN's members  \b \i0 \ul0 [*6a]\b0 \i0 \ul0   have already left the state; S.B. 1070 has made it harder for its staff to maintain its membership base and to recruit new members. For all of these reasons, BAN is a plaintiff in the litigation challenging S.B. 1070.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Maura Castillo, an Arizona resident, is a lawful permanent resident of the United States who is originally from Mexico, appears Latina, and speaks limited English. Subsequent to the enactment of S.B. 1070, Ms. Castillo was stopped, forcefully arrested, and detained by an Arizona Department of Public Safety officer after she failed to provide immigration documents upon request. The officer wrestled Ms. Castillo out of her vehicle, pushed her to the ground, and injured her shoulder before she was eventually booked into Maricopa County \b \i0 \ul0 [**67]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Jail. Ms. Castillo was released from jail with no criminal charges filed after state officials confirmed her lawful status. Ms. Castillo experienced great trauma from this incident and fears that S.B. 1070 puts her at greater risk of being stopped and questioned about her immigration status again due to her appearance and limited English ability.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Derechos Humanos is a grassroots organization in Arizona that promotes respect for human/civil rights. Derechos Humanos fights the militarization of the Southern Border region, discrimination, and human rights abuses by federal, state, and local law enforcement officials affecting U.S. and non-U.S. citizens alike. It promotes human rights and justice on the border through educational outreach and actions. When S.B. 1070 was first being considered, and after it passed, Derechos Humanos began to receive questions from community members expressing concern that their daily  \b \i0 \ul0 [*7a]\b0 \i0 \ul0   activities might subject them to liability under various provisions of S.B. 1070. These community members expressed that they were afraid to leave their homes out of fear that they will be subject to detention, investigation, arrest, criminal charges, and imprisonment \b \i0 \ul0 [**68]\b0 \i0 \ul0   under S.B. 1070.

A taxi driver, he fears that if S.B. 1070 goes into effect he will be stopped by state or local law enforcement officers and questioned about his immigration status on the basis of his Asian appearance and accent. John Doe also fears that he will be detained if he is stopped without his green card.

In 2009, she entered into a relationship with a man who later became abusive. When she tried to end the relationship, he slashed her tires; broke into her home; destroyed her furniture and clothes; and defaced the walls of her apartment. Due to his violence, Ms. Doe became afraid for her life, and for the safety of her two children. She applied for and just recently received U nonimmigrant status based on her \b \i0 \ul0 [**69]\b0 \i0 \ul0   status as a victim of violent crime. Federal immigration authorities are aware of Ms. Doe's presence in the country, and chose not to initiate removal proceedings against her while the case was adjudicated. Because of Ms. Doe's Latino appearance  \b \i0 \ul0 [*8a]\b0 \i0 \ul0   and her limited English speaking ability, she fears that she will be subject to interrogation, arrest, and detention under S.B. 1070.

Ms. Santiago fears for the well-being of vulnerable congregation members who could be stopped, detained, arrested, and questioned under S.B. 1070 and is concerned that she could be subject  \b \i0 \ul0 [*9a]\b0 \i0 \ul0   to prosecution under the transporting and harboring provisions of S.B. 1070.

These include the establishment \b \i0 \ul0 [**71]\b0 \i0 \ul0   of a day laborer center to providing a place for day laborers to wait for work and to negotiate fair wages with potential employees. The church does not inquire into the immigration status of the members of its day labor center. The church is concerned that members of the day labor center will be subject to detention, investigation, arrest, criminal charges, and imprisonment due to the various provisions of S.B. 1070. Further, the pastor of the church, Alison Harrington, provides transportation, shelter, and assistance to members of her congregation and other members of the community without regard to whether these individuals are authorized by the federal government to remain in the United States.
