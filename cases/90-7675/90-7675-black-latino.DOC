\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Cities and states across the country are facing a crisis of escalation of violence against people of color, women, lesbians and gay men, and Jewish people.  Some local governments, recognizing the harm that is done to groups, individuals, and society at large by this bias-motivated violence, are attempting to deter and punish the atrocities with "hate crime" legislation, such as that of St. Paul Ordinance 292.02.  The acts of violence, threats, and intimidation proscribed by these types of statutes are set against a backdrop of a historic reign of physical terror against the targeted groups.  Current violence serves to reinforce and perpetuate long-established inequality, and the killings, beatings, arsons, and other injuries cause grave harm to individuals and groups alike.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The St. Paul Ordinance, narrowly construed by the Minnesota Supreme Court, proscribes only bias-motivated disorderly conduct that rises to the level of 1) directed incitement of likely, imminent, lawlessness, Brandenberg, or 2) fighting words that are injurious or inciting immediate violence,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*8]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Chaplinsky. The narrowing construction by the Minnesota Supreme Court thus confines the Ordinance to conduct that is explicitly outside of the protections of the first amendment.  The Minnesota Court's interpretation of the Ordinance is authoritative, and it is that interpretation which must be reviewed by this Court.  \'a7 292.02, as judicially narrowed and as applied to the late-night cross burning on the lawn of a Black family's home, is constitutional.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Amici believe that the need to curb bias-related violence is so pressing and urgent that even if the Court were to find that some protected expression were implicated, the state has a compelling interest in restricting such terroristic conduct.  The conduct prohibited by \'a7 292.02, such as the cross burning allegedly committed by R.A.V, is not merely offensive and unpopular.  Such conduct has been proven to be the precursor, the trigger, the mobilizing event for violent rampage.  The state has often stated its interest in eliminating racist and sexist violence, and the severe harms inflicted by such violence are well-documented.  Given the context of multiple forms of violence inflicted against Blacks, Latinas and Latinos, Native \b \i0 \ul0 [*9]\b0 \i0 \ul0   American, Asian Americans, and women, the statute must be found to be a narrowly tailored means to serve a compelling state interest.  In finding the Ordinance constitutional, this Court should support the efforts of localities to combat biased-threats and violence against people of color, women, lesbians, and gay men, within the parameters of the first amendment.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 ARGUMENT
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 I.  ST. PAUL ORDINANCE 292.02, AS NARROWED BY THE MINNESOTA SUPREME COURT AND AS APPLIED, REACHES NO PROTECTED SPEECH AND IS THEREFORE CONSTITUTIONAL
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 St. Paul Ordinance ch. 292, \'a7 292.02 (1990), n1 as narrowly interpreted by the Minnesota Supreme Court, applies only to conduct falling outside the protections of the first amendment and is therefore constitutional.  This Court has ruled that "in reviewing the constitutionality of the challenged [state] statute . . ., we must abide by the narrowing constructions announced by the [state's highest court]. . . ." Posadas de Puerto Rico Ass'n. v. Tourism Co. 478 U.S. 328, 339 (1986). Minnesota Supreme Court's interpretation of \'a7 292.02 is authoritative, and it is this interpretation which must be reviewed by the Court.  Gooding v. Wilson, 405 U.S. 518 (1972), \b \i0 \ul0 [*10]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Kolender v. Lawson, 416 U.S. 352, 355 (1983). Thus, in determining whether \'a7 292.02 is overbroad, this Court must abide by the Minnesota Court's narrowing construction, which confines the reach of the ordinance to activity not protected by the first amendment. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n1 St. Paul City Charter, Legislative Code and Administrative Code, ch. 292, \'a7 292.02 (1990) (hereinafter \'a7 292.02), reads:
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Whoever places on public or private property a symbol, object, appellation, characterization or graffiti, including, but not limited to, a burning cross or Nazi swastika, which one knows or has reasonable grounds to know arouses anger, alarm or resentment in others on the basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender commits disorderly conduct and shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Minnesota Supreme Court appropriately "construe[d] the statute to avoid constitutional problems." New York v. Ferber 102 S.Ct. 3348, 3361 (1982); Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U.S. 491 (1985). It therefore explicitly limited St. Paul ordinance 292.02 to "expressive conduct that amounts to 'fighting words' -- conduct that itself inflicts injury or tends to incite \b \i0 \ul0 [*11]\b0 \i0 \ul0   immediate violence, see Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. at 572 . . . [and] conduct that is 'directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to produce or incite such action.' Brandenberg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. at 447." In re R.A.V., 464 N.W.2d 507, 510 (Minn. 1991) cert. granted sub nom.  R.A.V. v. St. Paul, MN, 111 S.Ct. 2795 (1991) (No. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 90-7675)\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  (hereinafter R.A.V.).  So interpreted, there is no "real" and "substantial" overbreadth of the ordinance: it prohibits only conduct that is unprotected by the first amendment under Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 314 U.S. 568 (1942), and Brandenberg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444 (1969). Broadrick v. Oklahoma 412 U.S. 601 (1973); Ferber at 3361.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Petitioner asserts that "[t]he ordinance prohibits the expression of ideas where there is no showing that any dangerous or unlawful activity will result," Brief for Petitioner at 21.  The Minnesota court, however, specifically construed \'a7 292.02 to be limited to such situations: where fighting words by definition invite violence or cause injury, Chaplinsky, and where expression is both intended \b \i0 \ul0 [*12]\b0 \i0 \ul0   and likely to produce imminent lawless violence, Brandenberg. n2 While the overbreadth doctrine, and the ability to challenge an overbroad or vague statute, Dombrowsky v. Pfister, 380 US. 479 (1965) remain vitally important to first amendment freedoms, \'a7 292.02 is characterized by neither of the invalidating flaws of vagueness or overbreadth.  \'a7 292.02 is a vehicle for combatting conduct, outside of the protection of the first amendment, aimed at particular groups traditionally targeted for the incitement of violence and injury.  \'a7 292.02 does not generally suppress public presentation or "mere abstract teachings," Brandenberg at 448, of white supremist or Nazi thought and literature.  It does not forbid racist or sexist viewpoints which subjugate groups of people: it is specific and narrow in its reach. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n2 In fact, the guidelines suggested by the ACLU are precisely met by the narrowing construction of the Minnesota court.  Brief Amicus Curiae of the American Civil Liberties Union at 6, 19, R.A.V. (calling for threat directed at specific victim, intent to instill imminent reasonable fear of violence).
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Where an appellate court does not limit the application of \b \i0 \ul0 [*13]\b0 \i0 \ul0   a statute to words that "have a direct tendency to cause acts of violence by the person to whom, individually, the remark is addressed," as in Chaplinksy, the statute must be found to be overbroad.  Gooding v. Wilson, 405 U.S. 518, 524 (1972). Such is not the case here: the Minnesota court explicitly construed the ordinance only to apply to that conduct prohibited by Brandenberg and Chaplinsky, and applied the statute appropriately to the facts in the case of R.A.V.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 II.  IF \'a7 292.02 REACHES SOME PROTECTED SPEECH, THE STATE HAS A COMPELLING STATE INTEREST IN PROHIBITING SUCH CONDUCT
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Because the statute as construed prohibits no activity protected by the first amendment, it need not be justified by a compelling state interest.  However, even if the Court concludes that the statute reaches some protected speech, the statute should nonetheless survive because it serves a compelling state interest and is narrowly drawn to serve that interest.  Boos v. Barry, 108 S.Ct. 1157, 1164 (1988). n3 Petitioner repeatedly attempts to obscure the compelling state interest served by this ordinance by referring to the conduct that is prohibited as "unpopular," "insulting,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*14]\b0 \i0 \ul0   " "intolerant," "offensive," "disagreeable," "disturbing," "resented," and lacking "civility," Brief for Petitioner at 10, 14, 15, 16, 18, 21.  Petitioner improperly analogizes this conduct to that which the Court has previously found protected by the first amendment: expression which is "provocative and challenging," has "unsettling effects," or "invites dispute, induces a condition of unrest, creates dissatisfaction with conditions as they are, or even stirs people to anger." Id. at 18, citing Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U.S. 1, 3-4 (1949); U.S. v. Eichman, 496 U.S.    , 110 S.Ct. 2404, 2406 (1990); Street v. New York, 394 U.S. 576, 591 (1969). 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n3 This Court has, on numerous other occasions, upheld statutes which restricted expression on the basis of their content or subject matter.  See, e.g., Bethel School Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser, 478 U.S. 675 (1986); City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986); Posadas; Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, Inc., 473 U.S. 788 (1985); New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747 (1982); Haig v. Agee, 453 U.S. 280 (1981); FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978); Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., 427 U.S. 50 (1976); Lehman v. City of Shaker Heights, 418 U.S. 298 (1974); Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973); Watts v. U.S., 394 U.S. 705 (1969).

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The conduct prohibited by St. Paul ordinance 292.02, as judicially interpreted and applied by the Minnesota Supreme Court, goes far beyond merely being offensive.  Understood in context, cross burnings are more than "displays of intolerance" or "expressive conduct that the majority finds offensive or demeaning," despite Petitioner's characterization of them as such.  Petition for Writ of Certiorari at 9, R.A.V. (hereinafter "Petition for Writ").  The acts prohibited by 292.02 amount to intimidation by threats of violence, and "[i]ntimidation by threats of physical violence is not protected by the first amendment." n4 U.S. v. Lee, 935 F.2d 952, 956 (8th Cir. 1991) (holding that prohibition of conspiring to burn a cross to threaten or intimidate targeted individuals in the exercise of federally guaranteed right to rent and occupy a dwelling does not violate the first amendment).  In upholding a conviction for a cross burning on the lawn of a Black family's home under 18 U.S.C. 241, the court of appeals for the 8th Circuit found that the nighttime cross burning on private property was
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 . . . It was not mere advocacy, but an overt act of intimidation,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*16]\b0 \i0 \ul0   which, because of its historical context, is often considered a precursor to or a promise of violence against Black people. . . .  To protect the inhabitants of this nation from such an attack on civil rights does not violate the first amendment.

Mitchell, 463 F.2d 187, 191 (8th Cir. 1972) (violent threats are devoid of constitutional protection), cert. denied, 410 U.S. 969 (1973);" U.S. v. Salyer, 893 F.2d 113 (6th Cir. 1989) (court affirmed conviction for cross burning under 18 U.S.C. 241 and enhancement of sentence because Black family was unusually vulnerable to the threat of cross burning).

Long, 935 F.2d 1207 (11th Cir. 1991) (when a cross was burnt on the lawn of a Black family in mostly white \b \i0 \ul0 [*17]\b0 \i0 \ul0   neighborhood, victim's race and specific circumstances can be considered to determine if victim was a "vulnerable victim" under sentence enhancement purposes).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Arguing that there is no compelling state interest and denying that any harm is done by intimidating conduct targeted against groups on the basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender, Petitioner further objects to judicial acknowledgement of the historical, contextual meaning of cross burning.  "Without citing legal authority, the Minnesota Supreme Court stated that the burning of a cross is a symbol of violence and hatred based on 'virulent notions of racial supremacy.'" Petition for Writ at 5.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 There can be no question that the example of cross burning in the case at hand is the very embodiment of racial violence and hatred, n5 a fact reflected in legal authority.  "[A] black American would be particularly susceptible to the threat of a cross burning because of the historical connotations of violence associated with the act. . . .  [T]he act has a special capacity to evoke terror among black Americans. . . .  There is a history of violence and intimidation which is directed against blacks and which is symbolized \b \i0 \ul0 [*18]\b0 \i0 \ul0   in a burning cross." U.S. v. Salyer, 893 F.2d 113, 116 (6th Cir 1989) (upholding sentencing enhancement for defendant who conspired to threaten and intimidate Black victims in the exercise of their civil rights by burning a cross at night in their yard in a predominantly white community).  The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has quoted a victim of a cross burning on her own lawn who stated she "hope[d] they don't come up here and burn us up." U.S. v. Lee at 954.  "[A] lot of the cross burnings in the South during the civil rights movement preceded hangings and that sort of thing.  Of course, being a black, that is what it calls to mind." I.d. at 956 n.5.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 A.  The state has a compelling interest in reducing the severe harm done to individuals and groups by bias-related violence.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 There is overwhelming evidence of the likelihood of imminent violence, and of the injury inflicted by the conduct itself, as a result of actions such as those allegedly of R.A.V.  Cross burnings in Kemah, Texas were followed by armed gunmen threatening the Vietnamese fishermen, and the burning of fishing boats owned by Vietnamese people in February 1981; in February 1983 in North Carolina, crosses were burned and shots were fired into the homes of two interracial couples; and cross burnings in North Carolina's \b \i0 \ul0 [*21]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Iredell County have been accompanied by high-powered-rifle fire into homes.

Where the placement of a symbol that one knows will arouse anger and resentment on the basis of race, gender, creed, color, or religion rises to the levels delineated in Chaplinsky or Brandenberg, it is only an ahistorical and decontextualized view of reality that permits the assertion that there is no showing dangerous or unlawful action will result.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 House burnings, lynchings, church bombings, and murderous shootings cause obvious harm no matter what the motivation.  There is, however, ample evidence that violence motivated by prejudice has a greater impact on its survivors than other forms of violent victimization.  National Institute Against Prejudice and Violence, Vol. 5, No. 1, Forum 6 (1990).  Victims of biased violence experience a much higher occurrence of serious behavioral and psychological symptoms stemming from the trauma.  Id.  See also J. Weiss, H. Ehrlich, B.

"The impact of ethnoviolence is traumatic and long-lasting. . . .  Their sense of personal violation is similar to that of the rape victim. . . .  They fear for their lives and those of their children.  Some victims move away from communities, looking for a safe place."

Petition for Writ at 5.  Our society has long mandated that the state has the affirmative obligation to protect against threats or violence designed to interfere with civil or constitutional rights.  Such protections, incorporating the duty to combat historic subjugation, are reflected in the 13th, 14th, 15th, and 19th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution; 18 U.S.C. \'a7\'a7 241, 242; 42 U.S.C. 1981, 1982, 1983 (known in 1871 as the Ku Klux Klan Act), 1985(c); and 18 U.S.C. \'a7 1091(a), (c) (Genocide Convention Implementation Act of 1987) (including as an offense the incitement \b \i0 \ul0 [*25]\b0 \i0 \ul0   to kill, injure, impair, or torture members of an ethnic, racial, national or religious group with the intent to destroy that group).

The Minnesota Supreme Court is not alone in finding that this social responsibility includes confronting bias-related violence.  The Congress, in enacting the Hate Crime Statistics Act, recognized the destructive impact of activities such as cross-burning, anti-Semitic graffiti, and bias-related destruction and violence when it authorized the U.S. Justice Department to compile statistics on bias-related criminal conduct based on race, religion, sexual orientation or ethnicity. n7 The Congress responded to "disturbing signs that the number of hate crimes has skyrocketed in this \b \i0 \ul0 [*26]\b0 \i0 \ul0   country. . . .

Cross burning on the property of a Black family in a mostly white neighborhood in the dead of night does not provide "the time to expose through discussion the falsehood and fallacies" of speech.  Whitney v. California, 274 U.S. 357, 377 (1927) (holding overruled in Brandenberg, but generally, Brandeis advising that in most cases, the "remedy to be applied is more speech.") Conduct reachable under \'a7 292.02 is that in which the "incidence of the evil apprehended is so imminent that it may befall before there is opportunity for full discussion." Id. at 377. For the five elderly Black women of Chattanooga shot by Klan members who mobilized for their ride of terror and violence by burning a cross at a prominent location, there was no opportunity for 'full discussion.' Complaint at 5-8, Crumsey v. The Justice Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, No. CIV-1-80-287 (E.D. Tenn. Mar. 1, 1982).  If the "right conclusions are more likely to be gathered \b \i0 \ul0 [*30]\b0 \i0 \ul0   out of a multitude of tongues," New York Times v.

U.S., 250 U.S. 616, 630 (1919) (Holmes, J., dissenting), such dialogue is not facilitated by conduct that silences.  For the 3,500 people lynched from 1866-1875, Scott-McLaughlin at 5, racist violence did not serve to enlighten nor to stimulate greater discourse, bringing society closer to the truth.  An imminent threat of violence, borne out by centuries of vicious brutality, is not designed nor does it serve to invigorate public dialogue or "produce a more capable citizenry and more perfect polity." Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15, 24 (1971). An infiltrator of the Klan for the San Diego Police Department explained that "If they needed to terrorize and intimidate people through burning crosses and other such activities, they would do that." Racially Motivated Violence Hearing 107-08 (statement of Douglas \b \i0 \ul0 [*31]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Seymour, Special Assistant, Center for Democratic Renewal).  Neither the purpose nor the effect of cross burning is to engage in lively debate: it is and has been to terrorize, to intimidate and to spark violence, even murder.  The effect of the conduct proscribed by \'a7 292.02, "tantamount to intimidation by threat of physical violence," Lee at 956, chills the expression of its targeted victims, as well as infringes their right to live, work, go to school, vote, make contracts and raise families with equal freedom as other citizens.  We cannot "assure unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes." Roth v.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 \'a7 292.02 is narrowly tailored to serve the state's compelling interest in forestalling the extensive harms of bias-related violence.  It proscribes only biased conduct that crosses the threshold into a directed, imminent, likely, concrete, incitement to lawless action, Brandenberg and its progeny; or when extremely personally offensive \b \i0 \ul0 [*32]\b0 \i0 \ul0   fighting words inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace in a manner that is directed to an individual, face to face, Chaplinsky, Norwell v. City of Cincinnati, 414 U.S. 14 (1973), Gooding v. Wilson, Lewis v. New Orleans, 408 U.S. 518 (1972). The proscription of such biased conduct is "intimately related" to substantial government interests in public safety and equal protection, as required by Village of Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 444 U.S. 620, 637 (1980). In Schaumburg, the state interest was only peripherally promoted," and there was only an indirect relationship between the restriction on expression and the interest of the state.  Id. at 636. In the case at bar, however, the restrictions are not an "imprecise tool" to achieve the legislative purposes.  Secretary of State of Maryland v. Joseph H. Munson Co., 467 U.S. 947 (1984). The link between terroristic acts like midnight cross burnings and violence is irrefutable and examples abound.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The scope of the harms inflicted by bias-related violence extend beyond those foresen in \'a7 292.02: lesbians and gay men are subject to horrendous violence.  With Petitioner declaring that "[t]his case provides a logical and appropriate setting for this Court to . . . clarify the standards for deciding the constitutionality of 'hate crime' legislation," Petition for Writ at 13, it is essential to briefly examine the state's compelling interest in regulating homophobic \b \i0 \ul0 [*36]\b0 \i0 \ul0   violence.  This interest is evident in the fact that sexual orientation was incorporated into the Hate Crime Statistics Act \'a7 1(b)(1), and homophobic violence has been specifically restricted by 15 states, 11 municipalities, and the District of Columbia.  The summary of the "Hate Crimes" bill that the Senate passed in February 8, 1990, noted that, from 1985-1986, the number of sexually oriented bias crimes had more than doubled." 136 Cong. Rec.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 CONCLUSION
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In the face of imminent threats of violence -- threats that are entirely credible in light of the reality and the history of rampant racist and sexist brutality -- the state should be able to protect the lives, safety, and well-being of the individuals under attack.  Petitioner's efforts to obscure this fact by invoking notions of "reverse intolerance" and "intellectual intimidation" must be dismissed as irrelevant, and incorrect.  Petition for Writ at 8.  \'a7 292.02, preventing only the most egregious acts of biased violence, cannot be said to "legislate social intolerance" unless criminal statutes can be said to be \b \i0 \ul0 [*39]\b0 \i0 \ul0   similarly 'intolerant' of violence, assault, and murder.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 From the vantage point of those lynched and raped, these laws may increase the likelihood of living without arson; assault; having to move; or having a church, home, temple or judge's chambers bombed.  Petitioner claims that what the state intends to illegitimately increase is "understanding." If 'increased understanding' on the part of members of dominant groups is a byproduct of the reduction of bias-related violence, it is not to be avoided, but the thrust of such laws is to protect the victims from real harms, not to enlighten the perpetrators.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Petitioner attempts to belittle the necessity of protecting historically oppressed groups and individuals from continuing threats and violence by equating that necessity with the desire to "avoid having one's feelings hurt." Petition for Writ at 8.  Not all disruptive or controversial speech, however, is steeped in centuries-long tradition of violent attacks.  Blacks, Latinas and Latinos, Native Americans, Asian Americans, Jews and lesbians and gay men are among the groups which have historically been subject to violent attack.  It is a manifest distortion of reality to claim there \b \i0 \ul0 [*40]\b0 \i0 \ul0   is an undifferentiated slippery slope leading from the midnight cross burning trespasser, to the speaker on communism or lesbian rights who offends and angers those who oppose those views.  Only the former acts, within a contextual history of violent attack, to subject a group of people to terror and utilizes a symbol which has been the prelude to widespread and severe violence.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The links between these specific acts which trigger, signal, or accompany violence have proven to be direct and intimate.  The Klan, for instance, responsible for innumerable killings shootings, beating, stabbings, house bombings, church and temple bombings, and acts of arson, n12 "intimidates its intended victims by terroristic signs and symbols, especially cross burnings." T. Clark, The South Since Reconstruction, 505 (1973).  The violence and the terrorization may have changed forms somewhat since slavery, and since 1871, when 297 Black people were lynched in one month in New Orleans, Scott-McLaughlin at 5, but racist intimidation or "disorderly conduct" under \'a7 292.02 is set in a historical context where the threat and the culmination of violence are very real.  As recently as August 30, 1991, a young \b \i0 \ul0 [*41]\b0 \i0 \ul0   man of color was found hanging from a tree with his hands tied behind his back.  Seattle Times, July 31, 1991, at 1,8.

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 For those people of color, women, lesbians and gay men not actually killed by bias-motivated violence, the costs are still severe.  Members of targeted groups are "denied personal security and liberty," Matsuda at 2321, and retain only second-class citizenship in a country failing to live up to its promise of equal protection.  With the government condoning, or at the least, remaining indifferent to bias-related violence, it is perpetuated institutionally: "gutter racism, parlor racism, corporate racism, government racism . . . work in coordination, reinforcing existing conditions of domination.

Rec. H3180 (1989) (statement of Rep. Gekas).  In a pluralistic society, we cannot overcome inequality by denying real differences in power, culture, history, and identity, nor by forcing the least empowered to bear the burdens of an "act of tolerance."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 There is a need for policies against bias-motivated threats not because such speech is rude and insensitive, but because there is a deep and pervasive problem of institutional racism and sexism which impacts, often violently, on the targeted groups and individuals.  Bias-related violence is but one form of subordination of powerless groups: subordination that denies people access to the systems that control their lives and constrains their ability to obtain adequate food, shelter, education, health care, employment; subordination that prevents people from living in intimate relationships, having healthy families, and developing an empowered community.  The strands of physical violence, economic violence, emotional violence are among those woven into the tight-knit web of domination and exclusion.  Proscribing bias-related violence is only a step, but it is a necessary step towards the elimination of inequality.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Accordingly, and for the reasons set forth above, this Court should affirm the judgment of the Minnesota Supreme Court and find \'a7 292.02, as judicially narrowed and as applied, constitutional.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 STATEMENTS OF INTEREST
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The CENTER FOR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS (CCR) was created in 1966 by lawyers who were active in the civil rights movement and the struggle of women and ethnic minorities in the United States for true equality.  CCR attorneys have been involved in cases concerning voting rights, community control of schools, fair housing, employment discrimination, jury composition, and international human rights.  Through litigation and public education CCR has worked to make meaningful the constitutional statutory, and international rights of women, Blacks, Puerto Ricans, Native Americans, Asians, and Chicanos.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Center for Constitutional Rights joins with amici to urge the Court to uphold this ordinance, which represents the attempts of local governments nationwide to combat the escalating violence against People of Color, women, and other historically oppressed groups.  Failing to uphold this statute,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*45]\b0 \i0 \ul0   which threatens no constitutionally protected expression, will send the dangerous message that this society, at its highest levels, will continue to tolerate vicious brutality directed against people because of their race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation and religion.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The CENTER FOR DEMOCRATIC RENEWAL (CDR) is a national, non-profit, tax-exempt clearinghouse for information on constructive, non-violent responses to hate group activity and bigoted violence.  Founded in 1979 as the National Anti-Klan Network, today the CDR conducts programs of research, leadership training, community organizing, public education and litigation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 With offices in Atlanta, Georgia, Kansas City, Missouri, and Seattle, Washington, the CDR also aids the victims of bigoted violence through telephone counseling and emergency assistance.  The CDR serves a diverse constituency of more than 10,000 members and supporters throughout the United States.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The CDR believes that municipal, state and federal legislation addressing the problem of hate crimes can both deter acts of bigoted violence and send a strong signal that such acts are not sanctioned by the community.  The CDR wishes to join as an amicus \b \i0 \ul0 [*46]\b0 \i0 \ul0   curiae in this case in order to lend the perspective of a national, multi-racial, interfaith organization dedicated to preserving and enhancing the rights of all persons victimized by bigotry and intolerance.  The CDR is of the belief that the constitutionality of the St. Paul, Minnesota, ordinance in question should be upheld.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The GREATER BOSTON CIVIL RIGHTS COALITION (GBCRC) was founded in 1979 to address increases in racial, religious and ethnic violence within the Greater Boston area.  The coalition was founded during the height of the busing and desegregation controversy that racked the city of Boston.  Today, the GBCRC is a coalition of over 100 private and public civil rights, law enforcement, religious, community and grass roots organizations who meet together regularly to discuss issues of discrimination based on race, religion and ethnic origin.  Among the priorities of the BGCRC, four have remained paramount over the past decade of the GBCRC's work:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 * Advancing the progress of civil rights by fostering harmonious racial, religious and ethnic relations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 * Improving communication among participating organizations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 * Training of law enforcement personnel in dealing \b \i0 \ul0 [*47]\b0 \i0 \ul0   with hate crime and violations of civil rights.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 * Focusing on shaping public and private policy as it relates to discrimination in the political, economic and social realms.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 * Advocating for the effective use of civil rights laws to deter hate crimes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The GBCRC took the most prominent role of any organization in gaining the enactment of the Massachusetts Hate Crime Reporting Act, signed into law in December of 1990.  That Act mandates the collection of hate crime data for the first time in the history of the Commonwealth; in direct response to the work of the Coalition, Governor William Weld recently appointed a Hate Crime Reporting Implementation Task Force, on which the GBCRC has several seats.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Coalition members support legislation to recognize the severity of hate crime and its resounding impact on effected communities.  The Coalition strongly believes that hate crime perpetrators should be punished for their acts, and that such punishment sends a message to both the victimized community and its victimizers: that acts of terror and hate based on the race, religion or ethnic background of an individual or a community will be punished.  We firmly support the right of communities \b \i0 \ul0 [*48]\b0 \i0 \ul0   to enact legislation which consistent with first amendment protection prohibits unlawful hate crime.  We firmly support the application of the St. Paul ordinance to combat the hate crime in the instant case.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The INTERNATIONAL UNION, UNITED AUTOMOBILE, AEROSPACE AND AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT WORKERS OF AMERICA (UAW), is a labor organization with approximately one million members headquartered in Detroit, Michigan.  The UAW is an industrial union representing private and public employees throughout the United States.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Since its inception in the 1930s, the UAW has been an instrumental part of the Civil Rights movement in the United States.  In the 1940s, the UAW established a Fair Practices Committee to monitor and improve the treatment of workers in the plants and to strive for broader racial justice in society.  In the 1950s and 1960s, the UAW worked with its allies for desegregation, voting rights, equal employment opportunity, and fair housing.  In the 1970s, the union won contractual non-discrimination protection in its collective bargaining agreements and the establishment of Civil Rights Committees in its local unions.  In both the 1970s and 1980s, the UAW supported the adoption \b \i0 \ul0 [*49]\b0 \i0 \ul0   of improved federal, state, and local legislation protecting minorities, women, and others subjected to the discrimination and bigotry still all too prevalent in our society.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Despite the progress made in the last sixty years toward racial justice in this county, there remains a strong undercurrent of virulent racism and sexism which too often manifests itself in hate crimes, violence, threats, and intimidation.  In response, many states and localities have enacted legislation intended to protect citizens from the tangible harm which results from being subjected to these actions.  In order to support these state and local initiatives, the UAW joins in this amicus brief.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The NATIONAL COALITION FOR BLACK LESBIANS AND GAYS (NCBLG) is the oldest Black organization in the country working to advocate and promote the empowerment and enhancement of the lesbian and gay community.  Formally a chapter organization with branches in Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, New York and Oakland/San Francisco, the national office is located in Washington D.C.  We have over 500 members nationally and our numbers are on the increase.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 NCBLG is presently working and addressing legislative policy and educational \b \i0 \ul0 [*50]\b0 \i0 \ul0   concerns that constantly confront the diverse communities of the country.  NCBLG finds that there is a need in the community for workshops, seminars, and lectures to provide training on these issues, as well as other initiatives such as our Project Dialogue, HIV/AIDS information and the Leadership Development series.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Since NCBLG began in 1979, it has been dedicated to equal rights and civil liberties for the entire community regardless of race, gender, or sexual orientation.  In spite of the strides that have been accomplished in the last 50 years, injustice continues to be prevalent.  This is evident by the increase of hate crimes throughout the country.  NCBLG wishes to join other progressive organizations which work to protect all citizens from the physical and psychological harm which may be a by-product of these bias-related crimes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF BLACK LAWYERS (NCBL) is a non-profit organization founded in 1968, and comprised of over 2500 lawyers, law students, legal workers and other individuals working for social justice.  NCBL and its members engage in affirmative litigation and activities to challenge and correct acts of injustice based on race, sex, religion \b \i0 \ul0 [*51]\b0 \i0 \ul0   and other irrational biases.  Cross burning is without question such an act.  We agree with the Minnesota Supreme Court's characterization of cross burning as a symbol of violence and hatred based on notions of racial supremacy.  Because cross burning represents the kind of abominable "speech" that we are working to eliminate, NCBL joins the other amici in urging this Court to uphold the Minnesota statute as constitutional.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The NATIONAL COUNCIL OF LA RAZA (NCLR), the largest constituency-based national Hispanic organization, exists to improve life opportunities for the more than 22 million Americans of Hispanic descent.  NCLR acts as an umbrella organization for its 139 affiliated Hispanic community-based organizations, which together serve 35 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico and reach more than one million Hispanics annually.  NCLR has four missions: applied research, policy analysis and advocacy on behalf of the entire Hispanic community; capacity-building assistance to support and strengthen Hispanic community-based organizations; public information activities designed to provide accurate information and positive images of Hispanics; and special innovative, catalytic,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*52]\b0 \i0 \ul0   and international projects.  In addition to its Washington, D.C. national headquarters, NCLR maintains field offices in Los Angeles, California; Phoenix, Arizona; McAllen, Texas; and Chicago, Illinois.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 NCLR has long recognized that Hispanics are frequently the victims of hate crimes and the targets of violent threats and intimidating behavior (i.e., "fighting words") because of prejudice toward national origin characteristics such as physical appearance, language or speech accent, and cultural characteristics.  NCLR is, therefore, particularly interested in the St. Paul crossburning statute case, R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, because of its important implications for the maintenance of constitutional protection from such dangerous behavior.  NCLR would like to join this amicus brief to show its support for the position that the prohibition of intimidating and harassing conduct in the subject case is constitutionally permissible.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The NATIONAL INSTITUTE AGAINST PREJUDICE AND VIOLENCE (NIAPV) is the only national center dedicated exclusively to the study of and response to violence motivated by prejudice - "ethnoviolence".  Founded in 1984, NIAPV is a not-for-profit tax-exempt organization \b \i0 \ul0 [*53]\b0 \i0 \ul0   under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.  NIAPV conducts research on the causes of ethnoviolence and its effect on victims and communities; serves as a clearinghouse of information; and provides education and consultation including human relations training, legal and policy analysis, and assistance to agencies and organizations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 NIAPV has conducted pioneering research on the prevalence and impact of ethnoviolent victimization on college campuses, in the workplace, and in the larger community.  In its National Victimization Survey, the first national study of its kind, NIAPV established that acts of violence motivated by prejudice have greater traumatic impact on victims than do other forms of victimization.  In addition, NIAPV is publisher of the most comprehensive legal manual available on criminal and civil remedies for violence motivated by prejudice.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Intergroup prejudice and violence tear at the very fabric of our society.  NIAPV believes that states have a compelling interest in protecting both individual victims and the larger community through legal remedies which recognize the unique harm inflicted by acts of bigoted violence.  NIAPV further believes that in \b \i0 \ul0 [*54]\b0 \i0 \ul0   tailoring criminal sanctions and civil remedies to address this unique harm, states do not thereby infringe on our precious First Amendment freedoms as they have been defined in decisions of the United States Supreme Court.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The NATIONAL LAWYERS GUILD (Guild) is a national organization representing over 10,000 lawyers, legal workers, law students and jailhouse lawyers in over 200 chapters throughout the United States.  Since its founding in 1937, the Guild has provided legal support to virtually every struggle in this country for economic, social and political justice.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The rise of hate and bias related acts in the form of speech and conduct in the past several years presents this society with the challenge to reconcile civil liberties principles of equal protection and free expression.  The Guild opposes bias, bigotry, and discrimination on the basis of race, gender, sexual orientation and religion.  When acts of hate, viewed in their historical context of perpetuating racial supremacy, infringe upon the ability of people of color and others to enjoy equality free of racial discrimination, the actor ought to be punished by the law.  Examples of such acts include cross burnings,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*55]\b0 \i0 \ul0   the placement of swastikas and the intimidating wearing of the Ku Klux Klan hood.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The National Lawyers Guild joins with the other amici curiae in this important case of public concern to present its views on the legal effort to combat White supremacy.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The NATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF BLACK LAW ENFORCEMENT EXECUTIVES (NOBLE) is a non-profit organization of police chiefs, agency heads, command-level law enforcement officials and criminal justice educators whose membership is numbered at approximately 2400.  NOBLE's goals are to develop, implement and manage innovative ideas, concepts and programs aimed at reducing violence, crime, and the elimination of racism in the criminal justice arena.  NOBLE was founded in September, 1976, during a three day symposium co-sponsored by the Police Foundation and the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Consistent with its motto, "Justice by Action," NOBLE aggressively pursues its goals by conducting substantive research, speaking out on the issues and performing a variety of outreach activities.  NOBLE's success in this arena is reflected by its growth and the major role it has played, and continues to play, in shaping policy in areas \b \i0 \ul0 [*56]\b0 \i0 \ul0   of vital importance to minorities and the law enforcement community.  NOBLE has effectively used the judicial process and direct correspondence to express opinions and concerns.  NOBLE has endorsed strategies that provide a holistic approach to crime and violence and proactive police-community involvement.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 What has come to be known as hate violence, racial and religious violence and harassment was first researched by NOBLE in 1983.  NOBLE received funding from the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) to do research on the problem and to develop model policies and procedures for law enforcement agencies.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 As a result, NOBLE published a law enforcement handbook that outlines a model response to racial and religious violence which is used broadly by the law enforcement community and social service practitioners.  NOBLE provided education and advocacy that resulted in the passage of federal legislation requiring the collection of data on the occurrence of hate violence incidents.  With a grant from the Ford Foundation, NOBLE has drafted a training program and produced a videotape for law enforcement workers on racial violence entitled Hate Crime: a Police Perspective aimed at training \b \i0 \ul0 [*57]\b0 \i0 \ul0   police officers in effective procedures for handling hate crimes.  In addition, NOBLE has developed a training curriculum to deal with cultural clashes on college campuses.  The curriculum is designed to sensitize college administrators, students and law enforcement personnel to the issue of racism.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Consequently, we are particularly interested in supporting the constitutionality of the city of St. Paul's ordinance that is the subject of this amicus brief, and we wish to join in this amicus brief.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The UNITED CHURCH OF CHRIST COMMISSION FOR RACIAL JUSTICE (CRJ) is the national civil rights agency of the 1.6 million-member United Church of Christ.  The Commission has long been actively in-volved in the struggles for racial justice and social equality of African Americans and other minority communities in the United States.  Established in 1963 by the General Synod of the United Church of Christ in response to the assassination of Medgar Evers, the Birmingham church bombings, and the heightened racial tension then gripping the nation, CRJ has been at the forefront of the civil rights movement as a church-based agency of a major U.S. Protestant denomination.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 CRJ programs have focused \b \i0 \ul0 [*58]\b0 \i0 \ul0   on a diverse range of issues, including: African American family life, capital punishment and penal reform, voter registration, racially motivated violence, child abuse, displaced homemakers, battered wives, teenage pregnancy, welfare hotels and homelessness, persons with disabilities, computer literacy, environmental racism, the empowerment of African American, Hispanic American, Asian Pacific American and Native American communities, and increasing the percentage of minority students in colleges through its scholarship program.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 For 29 years the Commission for Racial Justice has fought racial bigotry in all of its expressions.  We deplore acts of racist violence and see this case as a major opportunity for the court to affirm local governments in their efforts to thwart bias-related violence.  Incidents of racist violence are occurring daily across this country.  Equal rights and human rights must be extended to all, and not diminished by racist, violent acts of others.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The YOUNG WOMENT'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION OF THE U.S.A. (YWCA) is a national membership organization serving 2 million women and their families dedicated to the empowerment of women and the elimination of racism.  \b \i0 \ul0 [*59]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Since 1858, the YWCA of the U.S.A. has addressed the critical connection between providing services for women, girls, and their families and acting to correct societal conditions that create the need for those services.  Our members represent varied economic, social, racial, ethnic, and religious groups committed to the struggle for justice and equity and peace.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The YWCA's One Imperative, "To thrust our collective power toward the elimination of racism wherever it exists and by any means necessary," stems from our commitment to this struggle.  In both our programmatic and our advocacy work we are particularly concerned with the growing numbers of racially motivated acts of violence and targeted expressions of hatred.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 We believe that properly drafted statutes may be a significant deterrent to expressions of bias engendered hatred and bigoted violence.  When one individual of an historically oppressed group becomes victim to a crime based on her or his membership in that group, all members of the group experience fear and intimidation.  The YWCA of the U.S.A. wishes to join as amicus curiae in this case to contribute our unique perspective of a multi-ethnic, interfaith women's membership \b \i0 \ul0 [*60]\b0 \i0 \ul0   movement with the imperative to eliminate racism.  We are of the opinion that the constitutionality of the St. Paul, Minnesota, ordinance in question should be upheld.
