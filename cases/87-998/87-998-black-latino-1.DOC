\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 STATEMENT OF THE CASE
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This case involves the constitutionality of the Minority Business Utilization Plan adopted by the City of Richmond. n3 We generally adopt the statement of the case provided by Richmond in its brief.  What follows represents an amplified description of the City Council proceedings leading to adoption of the plan. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n3 Minority Business Utilization Plan, \'a7 27.10-20, art. VIII-A, Richmond, Va., Ordinance 83.69-59 (April 11, 1983) (hereinafter "ordinance" or "plan").  Reproduced in Supplemental Appendices to the Jurisdictional Statement.  J.S. Supp. App. 233-58.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In 1977, the Congress adopted a Minority Business Enterprise ("MBE") set-aside plan as part of the Public Works Employment Act of 1977.  42 U.S.C. \'a7 6705(f)(2) (1982).  This statute required state and local government applicants for federal public works \b \i0 \ul0 [*6]\b0 \i0 \ul0   funds to guarantee that 10% of the funds would be expended through MBEs.  Shortly thereafter, this Court upheld against constitutional challenge Congress' choice of the MBE plan "to ensure that [minority firms] were not denied equal opportunity to participate in federal grants to state and local governments . . . ." \b0 \i \ul0 Fullilove \b0 \i0 \ul0 v.\b0 \i \ul0  Klutznick,\b0 \i0 \ul0  448 U.S. 448, 478 (1980) (plurality).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Following the national lead, the Richmond City Council undertook an examination of the exclusion of minorities from participation in its own public contracting.  Council members had been concerned about minority participation in public contracting for some time.  Votes on a remedial set-aside at two meetings were postponed allowing further research and analysis.  J.A. 25-27.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 During the postponements, council members, city administrators and the city attorney worked on the matter over "a number of sessions." J.A. 26-27.  Their work included review of city construction contracts for the previous five-year period and analysis of \b0 \i \ul0 Fullilove\b0 \i0 \ul0  and other decisions passing on the legality of set-aside programs of various configurations.  J.A. 14-16, 24-27, 43.  On April 11, 1983, after hearing \b \i0 \ul0 [*7]\b0 \i0 \ul0   and public debate, the Council adopted the Minority Business Utilization Plan. n4 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n4 Richmond was not alone in this approach.  Since \b0 \i \ul0 Fullilove,\b0 \i0 \ul0  at least 32 states and 160 local governments have adopted minority set-aside requirements as part of their public contracting programs.  See Motion for Leave To File Brief of the National League of Cities, \b0 \i \ul0 et al.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  in \b0 \i \ul0 Richmond \b0 \i0 \ul0 v.\b0 \i \ul0  Croson Co.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  No. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 87-998,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  dated January 16, 1988, at p. 2.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The City Council's purpose in enacting the ordinance was explicitly "remedial . . . for the purpose or [sic] promoting wider participation by minority business enterprises in the construction of public projects, either as general contractors or subcontractors." n5 Councilman Henry Marsh, a sponsor of the ordinance, stated, in urging adoption of the set-aside plan, that the Richmond construction industry was characterized by racial discrimination and "exclusion on the basis of race" and that the need for remedial action was "not open to question." J.A. 41. n6 These views were echoed by the City Manager, Manuel Deese.  J.A. 42.  Statistics presented to the Council showed that, from 1978 to 1983, when Richmond had a minority population of \b \i0 \ul0 [*8]\b0 \i0 \ul0   50%, two-thirds of 1% of the $124 million of public construction contracts let had been awarded to minorities.  J.A. 12, 18, 41, 43.

\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n6 In formulating and supporting the plan, Mr. Marsh drew on 22 years of experience in Richmond as a practicing attorney, Mayor and member of the City Council.  He had accumulated detailed knowledge of the extent and effects of racial discrimination by private and public entities in Richmond as lead counsel for plaintiffs in numerous lawsuits, including: \b0 \i \ul0 Patterson \b0 \i0 \ul0 v.\b0 \i \ul0  American Tobacco Co.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  634 F.2d 744 (4th Cir. 1980), \b0 \i \ul0 vacated,\b0 \i0 \ul0  456 U.S. 63 (1982) (employment); \b0 \i \ul0 Carson \b0 \i0 \ul0 v.\b0 \i \ul0  American Brands, Inc.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  606 F.2d 420 (4th Cir. 1979), \b0 \i \ul0 rev'd,\b0 \i0 \ul0  450 U.S. 79 (1981) (employment); \b0 \i \ul0 Quarles \b0 \i0 \ul0 v.\b0 \i \ul0  Philip Morris, Inc.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  279 F.Supp. 505 (E.D.

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  \b \i0 \ul0 [*9]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Seven persons testified before the City Council on the set-aside plan, including representatives of various associations of contractors opposing the proposal.  J.A. 17-40.  None of those witnesses disputed either the fact of past racial discrimination in the Richmond construction industry or its continuing effects.  Nor did any witnesses dispute the remedial purpose of the set-aside plan.  Rather, these witnesses expressed concern over the lack of local minority subcontractors, the possibility that sham minority businesses would be awarded subcontracts, the potential that the plan would lead to increased construction costs, and the plan's possible anti-competitive effects.  J.A. 20, 28, 31-36, 38-39.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Aware that this Court had approved a set-aside plan, the authors of the Richmond plan carefully modeled it after the federal one approved in \b0 \i \ul0 Fullilove.\b0 \i0 \ul0  J.A. 14-16, 24-27.  The Council included a waiver and limited the plan's duration.  J.A. 12, 14-15.  The city attorney explained:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 "The reason for that and the suggestion that a date be put in, was that the federal cases that approved this sort of set-up have said that it's remedial legislation, and the purpose is to remedy past \b \i0 \ul0 [*10]\b0 \i0 \ul0   discrimination.  And hopefully, in some period of time, this program will cause that to happen.  Five years was deemed to be a period of time with which that would happen in all likelihood.  It can be judged at that time and either continued -- it may expire before that.  It's an ordinance that can be amended by Council at any time.  That was deemed to be a fair date to evaluate the effects of the program rather than leave it open-ended." J.A. 14-15.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Council considered the efficacy of the set-aside as a remedy for the present effects of past discrimination.  An ordinance prohibiting race discrimination in the award of city contracts had been on the books since 1975, n7 yet the facts showed that minorities had nonetheless been essentially excluded from public contracts from 1978 through 1983.  In contrast, Council was advised that the city's community development block grant program had utilized a set-aside requirement and achieved participation by minorities exceeding the goals of that plan.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This case calls upon the Court to consider once again the vexing issue of race-conscious remedies for the present effects of discrimination. n10 These remedies have been considered necessary to avoid perpetuating the effects of past discrimination. n11 Yet, the Court has recognized that such remedies, focusing as they do on race, are themselves problematic. n12

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Perhaps because of the clash of these competing values, the affirmative action cases that have come before the Court have generally been resolved by combinations of concurring opinions applying differing constitutional tests.  Although the requirements of these tests differ, they reflect the common objective of achieving an appropriate balance between substantial but competing rights.  Three types of such requirements are significant to the resolution of this case: (1) limitations on the kinds of discrimination a government may take affirmative action to remedy, (2) requirements for supporting evidence that the requisite discriminatory effects exist, and (3) requirements that the remedy be "narrowly tailored" to achieve its purpose.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The uncertainty created by the absence of a single approach in affirmative action cases was minimized in \b0 \i \ul0 Fullilove,\b0 \i0 \ul0  where six members of the Court approved the challenged minority set-aside.  While the concurring Justices employed differing requirements, each opinion exhibited a sensitivity to the particular context and avoided categorical rules that would skew the balance of important interests involved.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The remedial program challenged here,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*13]\b0 \i0 \ul0   like numerous similar state and local programs, was adopted, and approved by the District Court, in compliance with the most restrictive standard articulated by the Justices concurring in \b0 \i \ul0 Fullilove,\b0 \i0 \ul0  the strict scrutiny applied by Justice Powell.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 We show below that the Fourth Circuit reversed the District Court on the basis of principles derived from the plurality opinion in \b0 \i \ul0 Wygant \b0 \i0 \ul0 v.\b0 \i \ul0  Jackson Board of Education,\b0 \i0 \ul0  476 U.S. 267 (1986). \b0 \i \ul0 Wygant,\b0 \i0 \ul0  however, dealt with governmental action dissimilar in purpose, operation and impact on non-minorities.  The Fourth Circuit opinion effectively abandons the balance struck in \b0 \i \ul0 Fullilove\b0 \i0 \ul0  and should be reversed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 1.  The Court of Appeals held that the City could adopt a set-aside plan only to remedy its own past discrimination.  This categorical limitation, not imposed in \b0 \i \ul0 Fullilove,\b0 \i0 \ul0  adds no significant protection against abuse yet would prohibit a uniquely effective remedy for identified discrimination in the City's construction industry.  This Court should reject it.  In any event, the City of Richmond should be permitted to adopt the plan to avoid perpetuating the effects of that discrimination in its public \b \i0 \ul0 [*14]\b0 \i0 \ul0   contracting.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 2.  The Court of Appeals' restrictive review of the evidence supporting Richmond's plan disregarded this Court's precedents and usurped the fact-finding function of the District Court.  The District Court properly found that the evidence supported Richmond's action.  If this Court should change the applicable law and then conclude that the District Court findings are inadequate, the case should be remanded for further fact-finding by the District Court.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 3.  The Court of Appeals employed an analysis inconsistent with this Court's precedents in holding that Richmond's plan was not "narrowly tailored." Richmond's plan meets the tailoring requirements identified in this Court's cases.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The limits imposed by the Fourth Circuit have no sound analytical foundation, contradict the persuasive and authoritative holding joined by six Justices in \b0 \i \ul0 Fullilove,\b0 \i0 \ul0  and would upset the structure of remedial action by state and local governments that has been erected on the foundation of \b0 \i \ul0 Fullilove\b0 \i0 \ul0  over almost a decade.
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 ARGUMENT
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 I.  THE CONSTITUTION DOES NOT FORBID STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM TAKING RACE-CONSCIOUS ACTION TO CURE DISCRIMINATION AND ITS EFFECTS IN INDUSTRIES \b \i0 \ul0 [*15]\b0 \i0 \ul0   WITH WHICH THEY DO BUSINESS.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Court of Appeals held Richmond's set-aside plan unconstitutional because the Council lacked "a firm basis for believing that such action was required based on prior discrimination by the locality itself." 822 F.2d at 1360. That Court believed that the plurality in \b0 \i \ul0 Wygant\b0 \i0 \ul0  required "prior discrimination \b0 \i \ul0 by the government unit involved"\b0 \i0 \ul0  before an affirmative action plan could be upheld.  \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 1358, quoting 476 U.S. at 274 (plurality) (emphasis added by Fourth Circuit).  But \b0 \i \ul0 Wygant\b0 \i0 \ul0  imposed no such requirement.  Furthermore, if such a requirement were appropriate, it is satisfied when state and local governments award contracts to a construction industry they know is characterized by discrimination.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 A.  State and Local Governments, Like Congress, May Constitutionally Undertake Affirmative Action to Cure the Effects of Past Discrimination Whether or Not They Have Participated in Such Discrimination.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This Court has recognized that both Congress and state governments have a substantial interest in remedying the continuing effects of discrimination. n13 The Court, however, has not reached agreement on the kinds \b \i0 \ul0 [*16]\b0 \i0 \ul0   of discrimination that justify use of race-conscious remedies.  Among the Justices approving such remedies, Justice Powell has applied the most restrictive test.  In his opinions in \b0 \i \ul0 Bakke\b0 \i0 \ul0  and \b0 \i \ul0 Fullilove,\b0 \i0 \ul0  Justice Powell wrote that race-conscious remedies that aid some persons "at the expense of other innocent individuals" can be justified only to cure the effects of "identified discrimination" as opposed to "'societal discrimination,' an amorphous concept of injury that may be ageless in its reach into the past"; and that such remedies must be based on "judicial, legislative, or administrative findings of constitutional or statutory violations." \b0 \i \ul0 University of California Regents \b0 \i0 \ul0 v.\b0 \i \ul0  Bakke,\b0 \i0 \ul0  438 U.S. 265, 307 (1978); \b0 \i \ul0 see \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Fullilove,\b0 \i0 \ul0  448 U.S. at 497-98 (Powell, J., concurring). n14

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Notably absent from Justice Powell's formulation was any requirement that the "identified discrimination" found by the authoritative body be attributable to the governmental unit adopting the remedy.  Indeed, in \b0 \i \ul0 Fullilove,\b0 \i0 \ul0  Justice Powell found his "strict scrutiny" requirements satisfied by congressional findings of actions by private parties and governmental units other than Congress -- actions that would, "depending upon the identity of the discriminating party, violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \'a7 2000d \b0 \i \ul0 et seq.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  or 42 U.S.C. \'a7 1981, or the Fourteenth Amendment." 448 U.S. at 506. Justice Stewart complained in dissent that "there is no evidence that Congress has in the past engaged in racial discrimination in its disbursement of federal contracting funds." \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 528.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In \b0 \i \ul0 Wygant,\b0 \i0 \ul0  Justice Powell applied his test to a collective bargaining agreement between a school board and a teachers' union that required, in the event of layoffs, that more senior non-minority employees be laid off before minority employees.  The purpose of this provision was to preserve the attainments \b \i0 \ul0 [*18]\b0 \i0 \ul0   of an affirmative action hiring program.  The lower courts, effectively by-passing the issue whether the school board had itself discriminated, upheld the lay-off provision on the basis of a need for minority "role-models" on the faculty to remedy the effects of "societal discrimination." 476 U.S. at 274. The number of desired role-models was keyed to the percentage of minority students.  \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  In rejecting the "role-model" justification, Justice Powell stated:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 "This Court never has held that societal discrimination alone is sufficient to justify a racial classification.  Rather, the Court has insisted upon some showing of prior discrimination by the governmental unit involved before allowing limited use of racial classifications in order to remedy such discrimination." \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Fourth Circuit interpreted this language to add to the standard announced by Justice Powell in \b0 \i \ul0 Bakke\b0 \i0 \ul0  and applied in \b0 \i \ul0 Fullilove\b0 \i0 \ul0  a requirement that the "identified discrimination" be discrimination by the governmental unit undertaking the affirmative action.  822 F.2d at 1358. But neither Justice Powell, nor Justice O'Connor, who stated the new requirement less ambiguously,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*19]\b0 \i0 \ul0   n15 acknowledged any intention to change the standard or made any attempt to distinguish \b0 \i \ul0 Fullilove\b0 \i0 \ul0  or to articulate what useful purpose was served by the additional limitation.

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 We believe the most likely explanation for the language in \b0 \i \ul0 Wygant\b0 \i0 \ul0  relied on by the Court of Appeals lies in the particular facts of that case.  Discrimination by the school board itself was the most obvious, if not the only, "identifiable" discrimination in the materials before the Court.  The Court simply did not have before it the situation that was presented in \b0 \i \ul0 Fullilove\b0 \i0 \ul0  and is presented by this case -- identifiable discrimination by a party other than the governmental unit adopting the remedy. n16 The requirement of findings of "identified discrimination," without the further limitation to discrimination by the governmental unit undertaking the plan, adequately satisfies Justice Powell's concern that the "role model theory" and comparison of the percentages of minority faculty and students were insufficient predicates for the race-conscious \b \i0 \ul0 [*20]\b0 \i0 \ul0   action. n17

\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n16 Justice O'Connor's discussion of \b0 \i \ul0 Wygant\b0 \i0 \ul0  in \b0 \i \ul0 Johnson,\b0 \i0 \ul0  107 S.Ct. at 1462, contrasts "societal discrimination" with "past and present discrimination \b0 \i \ul0 by the employer"\b0 \i0 \ul0  (emphasis added).  Since prime contracting firms are employers, Justice O'Connor's test in \b0 \i \ul0 Johnson\b0 \i0 \ul0  could be satisfied under the facts here without discrimination by the City.
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n17 According to Justice Powell, the "role model theory" has "no logical stopping point" and would allow the Board to discriminate "long past the point required by any legitimate remedial purposes."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Fourth Circuit suggests that the limitation serves some purpose in preserving the "line between remedial measures and political transfers," 822 F.2d at 1360, but does not explain what, if any, additional protection the new limitation adds to the requirement that the discrimination to be cured be "identified." The Court's justification ignores identified discrimination by others and assumes that the only alternative to discrimination by the locality itself is unidentified "societal discrimination."

While Congress must find an affirmative basis for its authority in the Constitution, n20 the Constitution \b \i0 \ul0 [*22]\b0 \i0 \ul0   leaves States free to exercise all powers subject to expressed limitations.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In sum, the Constitution permits Richmond to exercise the power delegated to it by the State to enact a minority set-aside plan as a remedy for past discrimination by others without a threshold showing of its own participation in that discrimination.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Assuming \b0 \i \ul0 arguendo\b0 \i0 \ul0  that the Fourteenth Amendment limits a city's authority to remedying discrimination in which the city itself has participated, the Richmond plan should nevertheless be approved.  A local government becomes a participant in discrimination when it awards contracts to companies in an industry characterized by discrimination.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Richmond has a special interest in curing, at least in the context of public contracting, the effects of past discrimination by those in the construction industry.  In the absence of such curative action, Richmond's "facially neutral" awards of public contracts inevitably perpetuate the effects of past discrimination.  This Court in \b0 \i \ul0 Fullilove\b0 \i0 \ul0  recognized the importance of eliminating such state involvement.  Chief Justice Burger stated: "[C]ongressional \b \i0 \ul0 [*24]\b0 \i0 \ul0   authority extends beyond the prohibition of purposeful discrimination to encompass state action that has discriminatory impact perpetuating the effects of past discrimination.  \b0 \i \ul0 South Carolina \b0 \i0 \ul0 v.\b0 \i \ul0  Katzenbach,\b0 \i0 \ul0  383 U.S. 301 (1966); \b0 \i \ul0 cf.  \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 City of Rome [\b0 \i0 \ul0 v.\b0 \i \ul0  United States,\b0 \i0 \ul0  466 U.S. 156, 176-77 (1980)]." 448 U.S. at 477 (plurality).  He emphasized that "traditional procurement practices, when applied to minority businesses, could perpetuate the effects of prior discrimination," and approved a minority set-aside program "to ensure that those businesses were not denied equal opportunity to participate in federal grants to state and local governments, which is one aspect of the equal protection of the laws." \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 478.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Subsequent cases have recognized the States' interest in ensuring public access to commercial opportunities -- including those in the private sector -- free from the taint of discrimination.  \b0 \i \ul0 Roberts \b0 \i0 \ul0 v.\b0 \i \ul0  United States Jaycees,\b0 \i0 \ul0  468 U.S. 609 (1984); \b0 \i \ul0 Board of Directors of Rotary International \b0 \i0 \ul0 v.\b0 \i \ul0  Rotary Club of Duarte,\b0 \i0 \ul0  107 S.Ct. 1940 (1987). States have an even greater \b \i0 \ul0 [*25]\b0 \i0 \ul0   interest in assuring nondiscriminatory access to commercial opportunities they themselves provide.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 A governmental entity that participates in "business as usual" by awarding public contracts with knowledge of discrimination in the industry performing them violates the Fourteenth Amendment.  The entity under such circumstances is a "joint participant in a pattern of racially discriminatory conduct. . . ." \b0 \i \ul0 Ethridge \b0 \i0 \ul0 v.\b0 \i \ul0  Rhodes,\b0 \i0 \ul0  268 F. Supp. 83, 87 (S.D. Ohio 1967). There the court granted an injunction against a state construction project because minorities "will not be able to get jobs." \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  Although it was the union that refused to refer blacks, the court rejected the state's defense that there was no state action:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 "[W]hen a state has become a joint participant in a pattern of racially discriminatory conduct by placing itself in a position of interdependence with private individuals acting in such a manner -- that is, the proposed contractors acting under contract with unions that bar Negroes -- this constitutes a type of 'state action' proscribed by the Fourteenth Amendment.  \b0 \i \ul0 Burton \b0 \i0 \ul0 v.\b0 \i \ul0  Wilmington Parking Authority,\b0 \i0 \ul0  [365 U.S. 715 (1961)]. \b \i0 \ul0 [*26]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Thus, . . . where a state through its elected and appointed officials, undertakes to perform essential governmental functions -- herein, the construction of facilities for public education -- with the aid of private persons, it cannot avoid the responsibilities imposed on it by the Fourteenth Amendment by merely ignoring or failing to perform them." \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Other courts have accepted the "state action" theory articulated in \b0 \i \ul0 Ethridge.  \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Nat.

Supp. 800, 811-12, (S.D.N.Y. 1977) (government acquiescence in racially discriminatory practices by construction industry is a statutory and constitutional violation).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Limiting the power of States and localities to remedy the effects of past discrimination to those situations where the entity has itself discriminated does not measurably advance the goals of equal protection.  This Court should recognize that, at the very least, governments are not barred from attempting to free their own \b \i0 \ul0 [*27]\b0 \i0 \ul0   public contract awards from the taint of discrimination, whether their own or that of the industry that bids on the contracts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 II.  THE FOURTH CIRCUIT IMPROPERLY HELD THAT RICHMOND HAD NO FIRM BASIS FOR BELIEVING REMEDIAL ACTION WAS REQUIRED.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 We have considered the kinds of discrimination that can justify a set-aside plan.  We now examine the support for a conclusion that discrimination of the requisite nature existed here.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The District Judge determined after review of the applicable law and the evidence before him that
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 "the evidence before the City Council when it enacted the ordinance supports the conclusion that participation of minority businesses in the Richmond area construction industry in general, and the City's construction contracting in particular continues to be adversely affected by past discrimination." J.S. Supp. App. 163-64.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Although the District Court unambiguously found discrimination in the construction industry, \b0 \i \ul0 id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 163, its findings are less explicit with respect to intentional discrimination by the City itself (aside from the City's perpetuation of discrimination by others through its public contracting).  At the time of its decision, \b0 \i \ul0 Wygant\b0 \i0 \ul0  \b \i0 \ul0 [*28]\b0 \i0 \ul0   had not been decided and more precision on this issue was unnecessary.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Fourth Circuit on remand held the plan unconstitutional because the record failed to satisfy the requirement, derived from the \b0 \i \ul0 Wygant\b0 \i0 \ul0  dicta, for evidence that the plan was adopted to cure the City's own discrimination.  Rather than remanding to allow the District Court to consider the case under this new standard, the majority resolved the factual issues under that standard itself, without briefing by the parties.  822 F.2d at 1358-60. In contrast, the dissent concluded that "the Richmond Council had a firm basis for believing it had engaged in past discrimination in awarding public contracts." \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 1364.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This Court's determination of the kinds of discrimination that can justify a set-aside plan will frame the relevant evidentiary issues.  If this Court holds that Richmond was permitted to adopt a set-aside remedy to avoid perpetuating through award of public contracts the effects of past discrimination in the construction industry, then the District Court's finding quoted above should be adequate to support that purpose.  That finding should be affirmed unless clearly \b \i0 \ul0 [*29]\b0 \i0 \ul0   erroneous.  Alternatively, if this Court should require that the City itself discriminated, the Court would have to determine whether the District Court made an adequate finding on that issue.  If so, that finding should be upheld unless clearly erroneous.  If not, the case should be remanded to the District Court for reconsideration in light of the standard announced by the Court.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Regardless of how this Court resolves the issues in Part I, the Fourth Circuit's treatment of the evidentiary issues was erroneous.  The Court of Appeals violated three principles derived from this Court's prior cases that should govern consideration of the evidentiary issues in this case: (1) to preserve the incentive for voluntary remedial action by a party in jeopardy of suits from opposing sides, contemporaneous self-incriminatory findings will not be required; n23 (2) legislative action does not require record support of the formality necessary to sustain judicial or administrative action; n24 and (3) the district court plays the dominant role in finding facts. n25

\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n25 A district court's determination whether or not discrimination occurred is a finding of fact subject to F.R. Civ.

A determination whether a legislative body had a sufficient basis for believing discrimination justifying affirmative action had occurred differs from a court's determination that discrimination occurred.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 If this Court holds that the Constitution permits Richmond to take affirmative action either to cure the effects of discrimination in the construction industry or to prevent the perpetuation of those effects through award by the City of public contracts, it will then have before it a clear finding by the District Court, \b0 \i \ul0 supra,\b0 \i0 \ul0  p. 16, that the City Council had sufficient support for either purpose.  That finding is not "clearly erroneous"; indeed, it is clearly correct.

The Council had before it a striking statistical disparity: from 1978 to 1983, less than 1% of city construction contracts, a figure approaching "the inexorable zero," n26 were awarded to minority contractors in a city with a 50% minority population.  The Fourth Circuit rejected this statistical evidence, characterizing the disparity as "spurious": "[t]he appropriate comparison is between the number of minority contracts and the number of minority \b0 \i \ul0 contractors\b0 \i0 \ul0  . . . ." 822 F.2d at 1359 (emphasis \b \i0 \ul0 [*31]\b0 \i0 \ul0   in original).

Comparisons to groups narrower than the general population may as a general rule be preferable as evidence of discrimination.  Nevertheless, where racial discrimination at the "entry level" has thwarted the development of minority businesses or prevented minorities from acquiring skills, this Court has approved the use of general population statistics as a proxy for the number of minorities that would be present in the more narrowly defined population but for the effects of present and past discrimination.  \b0 \i \ul0 See \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Teamsters \b0 \i0 \ul0 v.\b0 \i \ul0  United States,\b0 \i0 \ul0  431 U.S. 324, 339-40 & n. 20 (1977); \b0 \i \ul0 Steelworkers \b0 \i0 \ul0 v.\b0 \i \ul0  Weber,\b0 \i0 \ul0  443 U.S. 193, 198-99 (1979); \b0 \i \ul0 id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 215 (Blackmun, J., concurring); \b0 \i \ul0 Johnson \b0 \i0 \ul0 v.\b0 \i \ul0  Transp.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This Court has accordingly avoided the "gross anomaly" pointed out by the dissent below -- "a proof scheme requiring a comparison of the percentage of contracts awarded with this small qualified pool of minority contractors would ensure the continuation of a systematic \b0 \i \ul0 fait accompli,\b0 \i0 \ul0  perpetuating a qualified minority contractor pool [that reflects discriminatory barriers to entry]." 822 F.2d at 1365 & n.11. \b0 \i \ul0 See \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Johnson,\b0 \i0 \ul0  107 S.Ct. at 1462 (O'Connor, J.). n28

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 "Contractors contended that the minority goals should be by individual trade/craft rather than a single goal for all crafts because to do otherwise ignores the unavailability of minority construction workers, both skilled and unskilled, and makes it virtually impossible for contractors to meet the goal." \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 65983.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 If this Court should hold that in order to justify the set-aside plan, Richmond must demonstrate that there was a reasonable basis for believing that the City itself had discriminated, the existence of the requisite evidence and finding is not so clear.  Two factors explain the ambiguity of the existing record and the District Court's findings on the issue of the City's own discrimination: members of the Council were reluctant to incriminate themselves or the City. n32 and the precedents available to the Council and the District Court did not require any finding that the City itself had discriminated in order to justify such a program.

\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n32 One Council member expressed fear that adoption of a remedial program would expose the City to liability for past discrimination (J.A. 15):
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 "CITY ATTORNEY: No, I don't feel that we're exposing ourselves to liability, but the Supreme Court, when it approved the ten percent minority set-aside, specifically said that the justification was that it was remedial.  We've reviewed the statistics of the construction contracts, and it certainly justifies that.  We have tried to tailor this ordinance as closely to the federal ordinance, which was -- or federal statute, which was upheld by the Supreme Court, as possible.  And, yes, it is remedial.  I don't think that's exposing us to any liability for prior acts.
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 "COUNCIL MEMBER: . . .  Doesn't the word remedial mean to make special efforts at the moment and in the near future to make up for prior deficiencies?
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 "CITY ATTORNEY: Yes.  In the term remedial, we're not just implying that the City was intentionally discriminatory in the past.  What we're saying is there are statistics about the number of minorities that were awarded contracts in the past which would justify the remedial aspects of the legislation.  We're not saying there was intentional discrimination in any particular case. . . .  And they allowed more use of broader statistics than they do in a lot of cases.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 We now consider the third criterion for evaluating the constitutionality of Richmond's set-aside ordinance: the requirement that the plan be "narrowly tailored to the achievement of [its] goal." \b0 \i \ul0 Fullilove,\b0 \i0 \ul0  Justice Powell cautioned that this requirement does not restrict a legislature to the "least restrictive" alternative.  \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 508.  Rather, the legislature's "choice of a remedy should be upheld . . . if the means selected are equitable and reasonably necessary to the redress of identified discrimination." \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 510.  Justice Powell described the measure of discretion accorded Congress "to choose a suitable remedy for the redress of racial discrimination" as similar to judicial discretion in choice of remedies -- a balancing process left to the sound discretion of the trial court.  \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 508, citing \b0 \i \ul0 Franks \b0 \i0 \ul0 v.\b0 \i \ul0  Bowman Transp.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This Court has generally considered the five factors, originally identified by Justice Powell, in deciding whether a remedy is properly tailored: "(i) the efficacy of alternative remedies . . ., (ii) the planned duration of the remedy . . .," (iii) "the percentage chosen for the set-aside . . .," (iv) "the availability of waiver . . .," and (v) "the effect of the set aside upon innocent third parties." \b0 \i \ul0 Fullilove,\b0 \i0 \ul0  448 U.S. at 510-14. \b0 \i \ul0 See \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Paradise,\b0 \i0 \ul0  107 S.Ct. at 1067; \b0 \i \ul0 Johnson, supra.\b0 \i0 \ul0  The Fourth Circuit misapplied these factors in reaching its alternative holding that Richmond's program was not adequately tailored.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 A.  The City Council Considered Alternatives.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This Court in \b0 \i \ul0 Fullilove\b0 \i0 \ul0  indicated that Congress' experience with other unsuccessful remedies demonstrated that it had adequately considered alternatives.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 "By the time Congress enacted [the set-aside] in 1977, it knew that other remedies had failed to ameliorate the effects of racial discrimination in the construction industry.  Although the problem had \b \i0 \ul0 [*41]\b0 \i0 \ul0   been addressed by antidiscrimination legislation, executive action to remedy employment discrimination in the construction industry, and federal aid to minority businesses, the fact remained that minority contractors were receiving less than 1% of federal contracts." 448 U.S. at 511 (Powell, J.).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Similarly, the Richmond Council had tried an antidiscrimination provision.  In place since 1975, this prohibition on discrimination in award of public contracts had not affected the barriers to entry preventing minority participation in public contracting.  On the other hand, the Council was advised that a set-aside used in the community development block grant program had had more favorable results.  See pp. 4-5, \b0 \i \ul0 supra.\b0 \i0 \ul0  The record shows that, based on their past experience, the council members selected a remedy they believed held more promise of success than other alternatives. n35 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n35 Because the set-aside effectively requires non-minority contractors to work with MBEs, it is the only alternative which may overcome "lack of confidence in minority business ability or racial prejudice and misconceptions." \b0 \i \ul0 Constructors Assoc. of Western Pa. \b0 \i0 \ul0 v.\b0 \i \ul0  Kreps,\b0 \i0 \ul0  441 F.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The set-aside adopted by Richmond is a temporary measure, expiring on June 30, 1988, five years after it became effective.  J.S. Supp. App. 247-48.  The Fourth Circuit treated the automatic expiration as something less than automatic -- "[w]hether the Richmond plan will be retired or renewed in 1988 is . . . nothing more than speculation." 822 F.2d at 1361.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The duration factor is used to guarantee that the program in question is a temporary remedy to cure the effects of past discrimination rather than a permanent mechanism to maintain racial balance.  In \b0 \i \ul0 Johnson\b0 \i0 \ul0  and \b0 \i \ul0 Weber,\b0 \i0 \ul0  this Court approved affirmative action plans as remedial and temporary in operation even though the plans contained no specific termination dates.  \b0 \i \ul0 Johnson,\b0 \i0 \ul0  107 S.Ct. at 1456; \b0 \i \ul0 Weber,\b0 \i0 \ul0  433 U.S. at 208-09.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Richmond established a 30% set-aside goal based on a 50% general minority population.  The Fourth Circuit criticized the 30% goal as arbitrary.  822 F.2d at 1360. \b \i0 \ul0 [*43]\b0 \i0 \ul0   This criticism is unfounded. n36

\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n36 Judge Sprouse, dissenting, said that "judging the set-aside percentage by referring to the small proportion of existing MBEs in the economy would perpetuate rather than alleviate past discrimination." 822 F.2d at 1367.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In establishing the 30% goal, Richmond applied Justice Powell's approach in \b0 \i \ul0 Fullilove\b0 \i0 \ul0  to the local circumstances.  Justice Powell approved "[t]he choice of a 10% set-aside [falling] roughly halfway between the present percentage of minority contractors and the percentage of minority group members in the Nation." 448 U.S. at 513-14. Although the specific number of minority contractors in Richmond is not contained in the record, the City Council was informed by the representatives of the construction industry who testified on the plan that there were few.  J.A. 27, 33-36, 40, 44.  The 30% figure falls roughly halfway between the minority participation rate, below 1%, and the minority population of 50%. n37

\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 ". . . it must be shown that every feasible attempt has been made to comply, and it must be demonstrated that sufficient, relevant, qualified Minority Business Enterprises (which can perform subcontracts or furnish supplies specified in the contract bid) are unavailable or unwilling to participate in the contract to enable meeting the 30% MBE goal." J.S. Supp. App. at 68.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Fourth Circuit rejected the waiver because \b \i0 \ul0 [*45]\b0 \i0 \ul0   it is limited to "'exceptional circumstances,'" and is a matter of "administrative discretion" and because the prime contractor bears the "burden of obtaining the waiver." 822 F.2d at 1361. The Richmond "waiver provisions were purposely drawn to parallel those approved in \b0 \i \ul0 Fullilove,"\b0 \i0 \ul0  822 F.2d at 1367 (Sprouse, J., dissenting), and the waiver approved in \b0 \i \ul0 Fullilove\b0 \i0 \ul0  was also available only "under exceptional circumstances." \b0 \i \ul0 Compare\b0 \i0 \ul0  J.S. Supp. App. 67 \b0 \i \ul0 with\b0 \i0 \ul0  448 U.S. at 494. In \b0 \i \ul0 Fullilove,\b0 \i0 \ul0  as here, the waiver decision was an exercise of administrative discretion.  \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 468-72. Finally, in each case the entity responsible for complying with the percentage set-aside (\b0 \i \ul0 i.e.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  the State or locality in \b0 \i \ul0 Fullilove\b0 \i0 \ul0  and the contractor here) is the entity that may seek the waiver.  J.S. Supp. App. at 189.  In sum, the \b0 \i \ul0 Fullilove\b0 \i0 \ul0  standard was followed and the contractors are given "the opportunity to demonstrate that their best efforts" will not achieve the "target for minority firm participation." 448 U.S. at 488 (plurality).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 E.  The Burden on Non-Minorities Is Consistent with Fundamental Fairness.  \b \i0 \ul0 [*46]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Inherent in the set-aside concept is the "[f]ailure of non-minority firms to receive certain contracts . . ., an incidental consequence of the program." \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 484 (plurality).  This burden is to be assessed to determine whether "the effect of the set-aside is limited and so widely dispersed that its use is consistent with fundamental fairness." \b0 \i \ul0 Fullilove, \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 515; \b0 \i \ul0 Wygant,\b0 \i0 \ul0  476 U.S. at 282-83. The Fourth Circuit erroneously concluded that the Richmond set-aside "imposes an overbroad competitive burden on non-minority businesses." 822 F.2d at 1361.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The burden imposed by the Richmond set-aside is limited in scope and duration.  The set-aside applies only to subcontracts and not to prime contracts.  Since it applies to all non-minority contractors, the burden is shared by many.  Those who share this limited burden inevitably include many who benefitted from prior discrimination.  Because these contracts represent only a fraction of construction projects, the set-aside affects "only one of several opportunities." n39 \b0 \i \ul0 Wygant,\b0 \i0 \ul0  476 U.S. at 283. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n39 Using census data, the City in its brief to this Court has calculated that city projects accounted for only 10% of all construction contracts during 1978 to 1983.  The set-aside thus affects only three percent of local contracting opportunities.  Because non-minorities can participate as a 49% owner in an MBE or can form a 51%-49% joint venture with an MBE and still receive a set-aside, the opportunities affected are reduced even further.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  \b \i0 \ul0 [*47]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Finally, this set-aside, unlike the lay-offs disapproved in \b0 \i \ul0 Wygant,\b0 \i0 \ul0  does not disturb any "firmly rooted expectation." \b0 \i \ul0 Johnson,\b0 \i0 \ul0  107 S. Ct. at 1455.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In sum, review of the Richmond set-aside plan in light of the five factors articulated by this Court compels the conclusion that the ordinance was narrowly tailored to achieve its remedial purpose.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law is a nonprofit organization established in 1963 at the request of the President of the United States to involve leading members of the bar throughout the country in a national effort to insure civil rights to all Americans.  Through its national office in Washington, D.C., and its local Lawyers' Committees such as the Washington, D.C. Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, the organization has over the past 25 years enlisted the services of thousands of members of the private bar in addressing the legal problems of minorities and the poor in voting, education, employment, housing, municipal services, the administration of justice, and law enforcement.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Mexican-American Legal Defense and Educational Fund is a national civil rights organization founded \b \i0 \ul0 [*49]\b0 \i0 \ul0   in 1967.  Its principal objective is to secure, through litigation and education, the civil rights of Hispanics in the United States.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund ("NOW LDEF") is a nonprofit civil rights organization that performs a broad range of legal and educational services nationally in support of women's efforts to eliminate sex-based discrimination and secure equal rights.  NOW LDEF was established in 1970 by leaders of the National Organization for Women.  In seeking to eliminate barriers that deny women economic opportunities, NOW LDEF has participated in numerous cases to secure full enforcement of laws prohibiting employment discrimination, including cases before this Court involving challenges to the use of affirmative action remedies to achieve equal employment opportunity.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People is a New York nonprofit membership corporation founded in 1909.  The principal objective of the NAACP is to ensure the political, educational, social and economic equality of minority group citizens and to achieve equality of rights and eliminate race prejudice among the citizens of the United States.  The General Counsel's \b \i0 \ul0 [*50]\b0 \i0 \ul0   office represents the 1800 branches in litigation involving voting, housing, school desegregation and employment discrimination.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Women's Legal Defense Fund ("WLDF") is a nonprofit, tax-exempt membership organization founded in 1971 to provide legal assistance to women who have been discriminated against on the basis of sex.  The Fund devotes a major portion of its resources to combatting sex discrimination in employment, through litigation of significant employment discrimination cases, operation of an employment discrimination counselling program, public education, and advocacy before the EEOC and other federal agencies charged with enforcement of equal opportunity laws.  In its pursuit of equality for both women and minorities, WLDF is committed to the use of affirmative action to achieve equal employment opportunities.
