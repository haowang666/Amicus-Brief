\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 INTERESTS:\b0 \i0 \ul0  The Maryland Legislative Black Caucus ("MLBC" or "Amici") is a non-profit corporation organized under the laws of the State of Maryland.  Its membership is comprised of the elected Black senators and delegates of the Maryland Legislative Assembly, and are as follows: Senator Decatur Trotter, Chairman, Prince George's County; Senator Clarence W. Blount, Baltimore City; Senator Nathan C. Irby, Jr., Baltimore City; Senator Troy F. Brailey, Baltimore City; Senator Albert R. Wynn, Prince George's County; Senator Larry Young, Baltimore City; Delegate Elijah E. Cummings, Baltimore City; Delegate Ruth N. Kirk, Baltimore City; Delegate Tony Fulton, Baltimore City; Delegate Ralph M. Hughes, Baltimore City; Delegate Howard P. Rawlings, Baltimore City; Delegate Margaret H. Murphy, Baltimore City; Delegate Nathaniel T. Oaks, Baltimore City; Delegate Frank Boston, Baltimore City; Delegate Curtis S. Anderson, Baltimore City; Delegate Kenneth C. Montague, Jr., Baltimore City; Delegate Hattie N. Harrison, Baltimore City; Delegate Clarence Davis, Baltimore City; Delegate John W. Douglass, Baltimore City; Delegate Richard N. Dixon, Baltimore and Carroll Counties; Delegate Nathaniel Exum, Prince George's County; Delegate Sylvania W. Woods, Jr., Prince George's County; Delegate Ulysses Currie, Prince George's County; Delegate Juanita Miller, Prince George's County; Delegate Christine M. Jones, Prince George's County; Delegate Gloria Lawlah, Prince George's County; and Delegate John Jefferies, Baltimore City.  MLBC was organized with the principle concern of legislatively protecting the civil rights of Maryland's Black citizens and eliminating discrimination throughout state and local government.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 INTEREST OF THE MARYLAND LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The MLBC is extremely concerned about the issues presented by this appeal because both the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Maryland Constitution charge the State of Maryland with the duty to enforce the protections guaranteed by that amendment.  Indeed, the resolution of these issues will have a direct bearing on whether the State of Maryland, its localities, and municipalities may voluntarily adopt remedial legislation aimed at eliminating the tragic legacy of racial discrimination. n1 Moreover, in the view of the MLBC, set-aside legislation n2 such as that adopted by the City of Richmond provides one of the most constructive and effective means for minority businesses to establish their presence in the mainstream of American economic life. n3 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n1 See, e.g., Md. Code, State Finance and Procurement Article, Sec. 11-148(b).
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n2 A "set-aside" program can require a majority prime contractor to award a certain percentage of his subcontracts or the total value of the contract to minority business.  \b0 \i \ul0 See, e.g., \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 J. A. Croson v. City of Richmond,\b0 \i0 \ul0  822 F.2d 1355, 1356 (4th Cir. 1987). Another type of set-aside would reserve a certain percentage of public contracts to be bid on by minority businesses only.  \b0 \i \ul0 See, e.g., \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Ohio Contractors Ass'n v. Keip,\b0 \i0 \ul0  713 F.2d 167, 168-169 (6th Cir. 1983). At least one federal court has seen no constitutional or operational difference between the former program, which is similar to that upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in \b0 \i \ul0 Fullilove v. Klutznick,\b0 \i0 \ul0  448 U.S. 448 (1980), and the latter, which is more akin to a "sheltered market" program.  \b0 \i \ul0 See, \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Ohio Contr. Assoc., supra,\b0 \i0 \ul0  713 F.2d at 173. District of Columbia minority contracting law defines "sheltered market" as "a process whereby contracts or subcontracts are designated, before solicitation of bids, for limited competition from minority business enterprises on either a negotiated or competitive bid process." D.C. Code, Section 1-1142(8).  For other types of set-aside programs.  See, \b0 \i \ul0 South Florida Chapter of Associated General Contractors of America, Inc. v. Metropolitan Dade County,\b0 \i0 \ul0  723 F.2d 846 (11th Cir.), \b0 \i \ul0 cert. denied,\b0 \i0 \ul0  469 U.S. 871 (1984); \b0 \i \ul0 Southwest Washington Chapter National Electrical Contractors Ass'n v. Pierce County,\b0 \i0 \ul0  100 Wash.2d 109, 667 P.2d 1092 (Wash. 1983).

Rev. 61 (1980); and Controller General, \b0 \i \ul0 Minority Firms on Local Public Works Project -- Mixed Results,\b0 \i0 \ul0  p. 9 (1979).
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Figures revealing the lack of Black participation within the construction industry in Richmond, or, for that matter, the State of Maryland, cry out for assistance of the type provided by set-aside programs. n4 One of the primary reasons for set-aside programs was best stated in a Department of Commerce report, which states:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The purpose of [the Set-Aside] requirement, which was introduced by Congressman Parren Mitchell of Maryland, was to help eliminate discrimination in construction and related industries and to bring minority firms into the mainstream of those industries.  The extent to which minority firms have been excluded from these industries in the past is illustrated by data from the 1972 Census of Construction Industries and the 1972 Survey of Minority-Owned Businesses.  These reports reveal that minorities owned only 4.3 percent of the construction firms in operation in 1972.  Furthermore, minorities received only one percent of the $164.5 billion earned by all construction firms in 1972.  The figures are similar with respect to those industries that provide supplies and equipment for construction firms.  Minority firms represented only 1.9 percent of the total number of establisments in the wholesale trade industry in 1972 and received only 0.3 percent of the gross receipts.  Minority firms' participation in Federal construction procurement in 1977 was also disproportionately low, with such enterprises performing only 1.2 percent of Federal contracts.  In addition, minority and female-owned firms received less than seven tenths of one percent of all contracting dollars spent by those state and local governments that responded to a 1973 U.S. Civil Rights Commission survey. n5

("Although discrimination against minority construction firms is difficult to document statistically, a number of studies have confirmed the existence of such discrimination.  See, e.g., R. Clover, \b0 \i \ul0 Fostering Minority Enterprise in Construction\b0 \i0 \ul0  (April 1975) (Report for the Center for the Study of Human Resources, University of Texas, at Austin, on file with the Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review); S. Taylor, \b0 \i \ul0 Catching Up: A Study of Behavior and Experiences of Minority Construction Contractors in Nine American Cities\b0 \i0 \ul0  (May 1973) (Report for the Charles F.

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Although the case before this Court does not directly address a state's authority to voluntarily remedy race discrimination, how the Court decides this case will undoubtedly have an impact on the ability of the Maryland Legislative Assembly, or any state or local legislative body, to eradicate racial discrimination.  It is for this and two other reasons that Amici seek to participate in this case.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 First, Amici recognize from personal experience as legislators the need for clearly defined remedial measures to combat racial discrimination.  The MLBC has sought to enact race conscious remedies at both the state and local level, but its efforts have been stifled by the lack of clarity from this Court.  While some governmental bodies prefer voluntary (non-statutory) set-aside programs, such measures have repeatedly fallen short of their goals. n6 In contrast, mandatory set-aside legislation that compels such action produces substantial results and propels minority enterprises toward the economic mainstream. n7 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n6 See Memorandum of Office of Audits and Investigations, Prince George's County, Maryland, \b0 \i \ul0 Minority Contracting,\b0 \i0 \ul0  dated November 9, 1987; Office of Legislative Oversight, Montgomery County, Maryland, \b0 \i \ul0 A Description and Evaluation of the County and Bi-County Minority Procurement Utilization Programs\b0 \i0 \ul0  (R. No. 88-1) (1988); \b0 \i \ul0 Hearing on the Small Business Administration Sec. 8(a) Contract Procurement Program Before the Senate Committee on Small Business,\b0 \i0 \ul0  94th Cong., 2d Sess.

\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n7 See n.3, \b0 \i \ul0 supra.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Second, the MLBC believes that the elimination of racial discrimination is of paramount importance to the State of Maryland as well as to society at large.  To achieve this objective, state and local legislatures must have at their disposal a full range of race conscious remedies.  The MLBC believes that if the Fourth Circuit's decision is allowed to stand, it would severely restrict the attempts of state and local legislatures to eradicate the lingering effects of prior discrimination.  See e.g.  \b0 \i \ul0 Michigan Road Builders Ass'n., Inc. v. Milliken,\b0 \i0 \ul0  834 F.2d 583 (6th Cir. 1987); \b0 \i \ul0 Assoc. Gen. Contr. v. City and County of San Francisco,\b0 \i0 \ul0  813 F.2d 922 (9th Cir. 1987) \b0 \i \ul0 rehearing denied; \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 J. Edinger & Son v. City of Louisville,\b0 \i0 \ul0  802 F.2d 213 (6th Cir. 1986). But see \b0 \i \ul0 H.K. Porter Co., Inc. v. Metropolitan Dade County,\b0 \i0 \ul0  825 F.2d 324 (11th Cir. 1987).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Thus, the perspective which Amici intend to convey to this Court is that of a legislative body which is constitutionally charged with the responsibility of enforcing the Fourteenth Amendment through legislation. n8 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n8 This Court has, in the past, recognized a constitutional \b0 \i \ul0 duty\b0 \i0 \ul0  on the part of the individual state governments, under whose authority the local governments act, to ". . . take \b0 \i \ul0 affirmative\b0 \i0 \ul0  steps to eliminate the continuing effects of past unconstitutional discrimination." \b0 \i \ul0 Wygant v. Jackson Board of Education,\b0 \i0 \ul0     U.S.   ,    , 106 S.Ct. 1842, 1856 (1986) (emphasis added) (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) citing as examples, \b0 \i \ul0 Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education,\b0 \i0 \ul0  402 U.S. 1, 15 (1971); and \b0 \i \ul0 Green v. New Kent County School Board,\b0 \i0 \ul0  391 U.S. 430, 437-38 (1968). For a view of how this recognition specifically affects Amici, see Maryland Constitution, Declaration of Rights, art. 24 (Equal Protection); see also \b0 \i \ul0 Hornbeck v. Somerset County Board of Education,\b0 \i0 \ul0  295 Md. 597, 458 A.2d 758 (1983) (held that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and equal treatment guaranteed by article 24 of the Maryland Constitution's Declaration of Rights were \b0 \i \ul0 in pari materia\b0 \i0 \ul0  and would most often be applied to the same extent); \b0 \i \ul0 State v. Good Samaritan Hospital,\b0 \i0 \ul0  299 Md. 310, 473 A.2d 892, appeal dismissed, 469 U.S. 802 (1984) (equal protection embodied by article 24); and \b0 \i \ul0 Lawrence v. State,\b0 \i0 \ul0  51 Md. App. 575, 444 A.2d 478 (1982), aff'd, 295 Md. 557, 457 A.2d 1127 (1983) (U.S. Supreme Court's interpretations of the Fourteenth Amendment act as authority for interpretation of article 24 of the Maryland Constitution).

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 TITLE: \b0 \i0 \ul0 BRIEF OF THE MARYLAND LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS AS AMICUS CURIAE IN SUPPORT OF APPELLANT
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 For over thirty years since \b0 \i \ul0 Brown v. Board of Education,\b0 \i0 \ul0  347 U.S. 483 (1954), this nation has chartered a direct course toward eradicating the vestiges of racial discrimination from every aspect of public and private life.  In achieving this objective, this Court has consistently supported the concept that both public and private institutions should voluntarily seek to eliminate \b \i0 \ul0 [*9]\b0 \i0 \ul0   the effects of discrimination.  And, while this Court has not spoken with a single voice as to what level of scrutiny should be applied to analyze the use of race conscious remedies, one thing is certain: racial equality should be facilitated in the least abrasive manner possible.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Recognizing the development of this fundamental national policy, the Fourth Circuit's decision erects a barrier that frustrates more than facilitates the achievement of racial equality.  In effect, the court of appeals' decision extends the mandate of the Fourteenth Amendment and \b0 \i \ul0 Wygant\b0 \i0 \ul0  far beyond what this Court has actually required of a legislative body by holding that the constitutionality of a race conscious remedy turns on an admission of prior discrimination by the governmental body itself and the volume and specificity of those findings which support that admission.  Neither the Constitution nor \b0 \i \ul0 Wygant\b0 \i0 \ul0  require a state or local legislature to admit that it has actually discriminated against minorities.  Moreover, allowing the court of appeals' decision to stand will no doubt have a chilling effect upon the voluntary efforts of public and private institutions to eliminate racial discrimination \b \i0 \ul0 [*10]\b0 \i0 \ul0   within and without their spheres of influence.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 When the court below reached its decision, it failed not only to consider the principles that were established in \b0 \i \ul0 Fullilove,\b0 \i0 \ul0  and later reiterated in \b0 \i \ul0 Johnson v. Transportation Agency, Santa Clara County, Caliifonia,\b0 \i0 \ul0     U.S.   , 107 S. Ct. 1442 (1987) but, also, to recognize the distinguishing characteristics of the legislative fact-finding process.  See, e.g., Alfange, \b0 \i \ul0 The Relevance of Legislative Facts in Constitutional Law,\b0 \i0 \ul0  114 U. of Pa. L. Rev. 637, 640 (1966).  As a result, the court of appeals was unable to discern the factual and institutional distinctions between the findings involved in \b0 \i \ul0 Wygant\b0 \i0 \ul0  and those of the Richmond City Council.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Finally, by requiring a legislative body to make findings of its own acts of discrimination the court below imposed on legislatures a findings requirement similar to that of a judicial or administrative body.  By elevating legislative findings to such standards the decision unnecessarily results in an intrusion by the judiciary into the legislative process, thereby upsetting the balance of governmental powers in our nation.  Such imposition presents a clear threat \b \i0 \ul0 [*11]\b0 \i0 \ul0   to the legislative process that this Court has on numerous occasions fought to prevent.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 If the decision below is allowed to stand it would not only impede the achievement of an important public policy, that is, the elimination of racial discrimination, but would also begin to erode accepted separation of powers principles.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 ARGUMENT
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In a color-blind society, a "race conscious remedy" would have no application or meaning.  See e.g., \b0 \i \ul0 Charlotte-Mecklenburg, supra,\b0 \i0 \ul0  402 U.S. at 1, 28. Unfortunately, America's past has exemplified anything but a color-blind society. n9 \b0 \i \ul0 Dred Scott v. Sandford,\b0 \i0 \ul0  60 U.S. (19 How.) 393, 407 (1857); \b0 \i \ul0 Plessy v. Ferguson,\b0 \i0 \ul0  163 U.S. 537, 559-60 (1896) (Harlan J., dissenting).  "For black Americans, racial equality is a tradition without a past." Coleman, EQUALITY -- NOT YET, N.Y. Times, July 13, 1981, at A15, Col.2.  For over thirty years, since \b0 \i \ul0 Brown v. Board of Education, supra,\b0 \i0 \ul0  this Court, the Congress, the President, and the various branches of state and local governments have struggled to make racial equality a tradition. n10 The experience has not been without pain and conflict.  The \b \i0 \ul0 [*12]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Fourth Circuit's decision in \b0 \i \ul0 Croson\b0 \i0 \ul0  is no exception.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Instead of translating racial equality into a national policy in the least abrasive manner possible, the court below frustrates the process by creating tension between the legislative and judicial branches of government.  The court of appeals accomplishes this obstruction by imposing more stringent fact-finding requirements on a legislative body than have ever been conceived by this Court.  At the heart of the court of appeals analysis is a subliminal struggle to apply color-blind principles, despite this Court's previous holdings to the contrary. n11 The decision of the court below raises the very issue presented by all affirmative action cases, which is: how does our society reconcile the past with its egalitarian ideals. n12

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The first prong requires an inquiry into the governmental interest being vindicated.  Inclusive within the first prong is a determination of whether the governmental entity adopting the race conscious remedy is competent to make findings of racial discrimination to establish a sufficiently important or compelling governmental interest.  See \b0 \i \ul0 Paradise, supra,\b0 \i0 \ul0  107 S. Ct. at 1064 n.17; \b0 \i \ul0 Wygant, supra,\b0 \i0 \ul0  106 S.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The second prong of the equal protection analysis focuses on whether the means chosen are sufficiently related to effectuating the governmental interest.  \b0 \i \ul0 Paradise, supra,\b0 \i0 \ul0  107 S. Ct. at 1064 (plurality opinion); \b0 \i \ul0 Sheet Metal Workers, supra,\b0 \i0 \ul0  106 S. Ct. at 3052-53 (plurality opinion).  This Court has established that race conscious relief need not be limited to victims of prior discrimination, and that \b \i0 \ul0 [*16]\b0 \i0 \ul0   "innocent persons may be called upon to bear some of the burden of the remedy." \b0 \i \ul0 Wygant, supra,\b0 \i0 \ul0  106 S.

These few established principles in what has become a complex area of the law are now jeopardized by the Fourth Circuit's decision in this case.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Fourth Circuit's interpretation of \b0 \i \ul0 Wygant\b0 \i0 \ul0  makes unreasonable demands of a state or local government seeking to eradicate prior racial discrimination.  First, the court below would require a governmental body to specifically admit or concede that it had affirmatively engaged in discriminatory practices.  This requirement has been specifically criticized by members of this Court in \b0 \i \ul0 Wygant\b0 \i0 \ul0  and other decisions. n14 \b0 \i \ul0 Wygant, supra,\b0 \i0 \ul0  106 S. Ct. at 1855. The court of appeals' decision would have the practical effect of not only discouraging enforcement \b \i0 \ul0 [*17]\b0 \i0 \ul0   of the Fourteenth Amendment, but also severely curtailing the power of legislative bodies to combat racial discrimination since the legislative process is not particularly well suited for such individualized findings. n15 Second, the Fourth Circuit further misapplied \b0 \i \ul0 Wygant\b0 \i0 \ul0  by holding that the Richmond Plan was not sufficiently "narrowly tailored" to meet its remedial goal. n16 If the court of appeals decision is allowed to stand it would so narrowly tailor race conscious remedies as to render such remedies ineffective, despite this nation's commitment to making racial equality a tradition.

\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 . . . [A] requirement that public employers make findings that they have engaged in illegal discrimination . . . would severely undermine public employers' incentive to meet voluntarily their civil rights obligations . . . .

See also n.20, \b0 \i \ul0 infra.\b0 \i0 \ul0  Justice O'Connor reaffirmed her position in a separate opinion to this Court's decision in \b0 \i \ul0 Johnson\b0 \i0 \ul0  when she stated in reference to affirmative action plans under a Title VII analysis, that:

This recognition of the potentially stifling effect which such a strict requirement would have on voluntary remedial action by public bodies is also addressed in the context of school desegregation by other members of the Court in \b0 \i \ul0 Wygant\b0 \i0 \ul0  in the following manner:
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The real irony of the argument urging mandatory, formal findings of discrimination lies in its complete disregard for a longstanding goal of civil rights reform, that of integrating schools without taking every school system to court.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 As part of the legislative process, Amici believe that the Fourth Circuit's decision effected an unprecedented burden upon legislative bodies not contemplated by this Court in \b0 \i \ul0 Wygant\b0 \i0 \ul0  nor by the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Because of the unprecedented barriers to the implementation of affirmative action programs created by the court of appeals' decision, Amici will focus their attention on the first prong of the court of appeals' decision. n17 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n17 Amici have chosen to focus on the Fourth Circuit's implementation of the first prong of its equal protection analysis because that use strikes at the very heart of the legislative process.  Amici do not, however, concede the correctness of the court of appeals' usage as to the second prong of its equal protection analysis.  Amici therefore defers to the views of the City of Richmond and other supportive amici, who more than adequately address the court of appeals' analysis of the second prong.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 A.  The Equal Protection Clause does not require a governmental unit that voluntarily seeks to eliminate the effects of racial discrimination to admit or concede it actually engaged in discriminatory practices.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Fourth Circuit \b \i0 \ul0 [*19]\b0 \i0 \ul0   decision would essentially require every state or local legislative body to find that it had actually discriminated before implementing a race conscious remedy.  The court of appeals' conclusion radically expands \b0 \i \ul0 Wygant\b0 \i0 \ul0  and the Fourteenth Amendment far beyond what this Court intended and is without precedent.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 According to the Fourth Circuit's interpretation of this Court's decision in \b0 \i \ul0 Wygant,\b0 \i0 \ul0  before a governmental interest in a racial preference can be accepted as "compelling," "there must be findings of prior discrimination." \b0 \i \ul0 Croson, supra,\b0 \i0 \ul0  822 F.2d at 1358. Moreover, these findings must be predicated on more than societal discrimination, instead they must concern prior discrimination "by the government unit involved." \b0 \i \ul0 Id.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  citing \b0 \i \ul0 Wygant, supra,\b0 \i0 \ul0  106 S. Ct. at 1847. Against this background, the court of appeals found the Richmond City Council's findings seriously wanting and without foundation for establishing a compelling interest which would justify the use of racial classifications in its contracting program.  The ruling by the court of appeals, however, totally ignores the principles established in \b0 \i \ul0 Fullilove,\b0 \i0 \ul0  which was decided \b \i0 \ul0 [*20]\b0 \i0 \ul0   by this Court prior to \b0 \i \ul0 Wygant, supra.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The requirements of finding discrimination and the corresponding authority or competence to engage in such remedial action were first raised by Justice Powell in \b0 \i \ul0 Bakke\b0 \i0 \ul0  n18 and, later, more specifically addressed in \b0 \i \ul0 Fullilove,\b0 \i0 \ul0  when he said:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 . . . The degree of specificity required in the findings of discrimination and the breadth of discretion in the choice of remedies may vary with the nature and authority of a governmental body.  448 U.S. at 515-16 n.14.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Justice Powell declined to answer the question he posed in \b0 \i \ul0 Fullilove\b0 \i0 \ul0  as to what degree of factual specificity is required to justify the use of race conscious remedies.  One court has noted that "there is no consensus on what findings of past discrimination justify remedial affirmative action." \b0 \i \ul0 Valentine v. Smith,\b0 \i0 \ul0  654 F.2d 503, 509 (8th Cir. 1981). And, it was in this void that the court below sought to establish standards that exceeded those in both \b0 \i \ul0 Wygant\b0 \i0 \ul0  and \b0 \i \ul0 Fullilove.\b0 \i0 \ul0  n19 A close examination of past affirmative action cases and particularly \b0 \i \ul0 Fullilove\b0 \i0 \ul0  reveals, however, that the degree of findings necessary for a legislative \b \i0 \ul0 [*21]\b0 \i0 \ul0   body n20 to demonstrate a compelling government interest is not as rigorous as the court of appeals would have us accept. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n18 In \b0 \i \ul0 Bakke,\b0 \i0 \ul0  Justice Powell stated that a governmental race conscious remedy is only constitutional if a "competent" body makes sufficient "findings" of past discrimination justifying such program.  He concluded that the Board of Regents of the University of California was not competent to address societal discrimination, nor did it make adequately specific findings to support its affirmative action program.  \b0 \i \ul0 Bakke, supra,\b0 \i0 \ul0  438 U.S. at 307-10 (opinion of Powell, J.).
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n19 The court of appeals cited \b0 \i \ul0 Valentine v. Smith, supra,\b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0  \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Kromnick v.

In \b0 \i \ul0 Dayton Board of Education v. Brinkman,\b0 \i0 \ul0  433 U.S. 406 (1977), this Court determined that federal courts were also competent to make findings.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In \b0 \i \ul0 Fullilove,\b0 \i0 \ul0  this Court ruled on the power of Congress to adopt a "Minority Business Enterprise" (MBE) provision of the Public Works Employment Act of 1977. n21 That program was not unlike the Richmond Plan and others.  In upholding the constitutionality of the MBE provision, this Court approved Congress' findings of past discrimination even though it had failed to make "specific factual findings" of statutory or constitutional violations.  \b0 \i \ul0 Fullilove, supra,\b0 \i0 \ul0  448 U.S. at 478. Indeed, the findings that Congress did make presented no clear and specific evidence of racial discrimination by the federal government in the disbursement of federal contracting funds.  See, \b0 \i \ul0 Id.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 527 (Stewart J., dissenting).  Interestingly, even Justice Powell implicitly ignored his own "specific findings" requirement by expressly adopting that portion of Chief Justice Burger's opinion that endorsed Congress' findings.  \b0 \i \ul0 Id.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 453, 495. n22 Moreover, Justice Powell and Chief Justice Burger found that the low number of public contracts awarded minority businesses contained in the legislative history of the MBE provision, was sufficient to justify Congress'  \b \i0 \ul0 [*23]\b0 \i0 \ul0   remedial action.  \b0 \i \ul0 Id.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 456-67 (opinion of Burger, C.J.); \b0 \i \ul0 Id.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 502-06 (Powell, J., concurring).  Implicit in this Court's \b0 \i \ul0 Fullilove\b0 \i0 \ul0  decision was the reestablishment of the principle that race conscious remedies need not be dependent on finding the government guilty of discrimination, but instead they must be directed at remedying the effects of discrimination within the particular governmental entity's sphere of influence.  This principle, which was set forth in \b0 \i \ul0 Fullilove\b0 \i0 \ul0  is not foreign, n23 and it later resurfaced in \b0 \i \ul0 Johnson, supra.\b0 \i0 \ul0

Ct. at 1442 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (emphasis in original).  Justice O'Connor in \b0 \i \ul0 Johnson\b0 \i0 \ul0  also acknowledged that "the proper initial inquiry in evaluating the legality of an affirmative action plan by a public employer under Title VII is no different from that required by the Equal Protection Clause." \b0 \i \ul0 Id.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 1461 (O'Connor, J., concurring).  And, in \b0 \i \ul0 Paradise, supra,\b0 \i0 \ul0  107 S.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In fact, while the court below seemed to implicitly acknowledge Justice O'Connor's concerns in \b0 \i \ul0 Wygant,\b0 \i0 \ul0  about the inherent problems presented by the findings requirement, it disregarded those concerns and instead placed heavy reliance on the following language of the plurality opinion:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This Court has never held that societal discrimination alone is sufficient to justify a racial classification.  Rather, the Court has insisted upon some showing of prior discrimination by the governmental unit involved before allowing limited use of racial classifications in order to remedy such discrimination.  \b0 \i \ul0 Wygant, supra,\b0 \i0 \ul0  106 S. Ct. at 1847 (plurality opinion).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In relying on this language the court below totally misapplied the intent of \b0 \i \ul0 Wygant.\b0 \i0 \ul0  In \b0 \i \ul0 Wygant\b0 \i0 \ul0  a plurality of this Court held that societal discrimination alone was insufficient to justify race conscious remedies.  \b0 \i \ul0 Id.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 1847-48. The court of appeals, after examining how the Richmond City Council conducted its findings, concluded that societal discrimination was the only basis for enacting the Richmond Plan.  The court below reached this conclusion despite the Richmond City Council having held a hearing,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*27]\b0 \i0 \ul0   heard testimony, and drawn on its own experience n28 and that of Congress, n29 to reach its findings.  The cumulative result of these findings revealed the existence of purposeful discrimination within the construction industry, and the City of Richmond's passive participation in such discrimination by its awarding of construction contracts to that industry. n30 In \b0 \i \ul0 Wygant\b0 \i0 \ul0  the Board of Education of Jackson, Michigan made no such findings, particularly of the degree accomplished by the Richmond City Council. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n28 As this Court is well aware, the City of Richmond has experienced on numerous occasions the need to eradicate racial barriers within its government and the community at large.  \b0 \i \ul0 See e.g., \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 City of Richmond v. United States,\b0 \i0 \ul0  422 U.S. 358 (1975) (this case focused on the city's annexation plan relative to its compliance with the Voting Rights Act); \b0 \i \ul0 Bradley v. School Board,\b0 \i0 \ul0  462 F.2d 1058, 1065 (4th Cir. 1972) (en banc) (this case involved school desegregation, where it was found that the city tended to "perpetuate apartheid of the races"); aff'd by an equally divided Court, 412 U.S. 92 (1973) (per curiam).
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n29 In relying on Congress' findings that: "there was direct evidence . . . that . . . discrimination existed with respect to state and local construction contracting as well . . .", the City Council was drawing upon a wide array of sources to reach its conclusion.  The use of other sources of information to supplement a governmental entity's own peculiar findings was recently upheld in \b0 \i \ul0 City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  475 U.S. 41, 51 (1986). In \b0 \i \ul0 City of Renton,\b0 \i0 \ul0  this Court held that a city's "substantial governmental interest" in regulating the time, place, or manner of protected speech may be established by findings and studies generated by other cities, "so long as whatever evidence the city relies upon is reasonably believed to be relevant to the problem that the city addresses." 475 U.S. at 51-51. Further support for such "borrowing" has also begun to gain acceptance from the academic community.  See Days, \b0 \i \ul0 Fullilove\b0 \i0 \ul0  96 Yale L. J. 453, 480 (1987) (the author in analyzing the necessity for findings) states: "State and local agencies creating set-asides should, for example, be able to rely in part from federal legislative or agency findings and judicial determinations regarding nationwide discrimination against minority business enterprises as predicates for considering the propriety of set-asides in their respective jurisdictions").
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n30 The district court agreed with the City Council's findings, after it had heard all of the facts.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  \b \i0 \ul0 [*28]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This Court found in \b0 \i \ul0 Wygant\b0 \i0 \ul0  that the Jackson Board of Education's race conscious layoff plan was seriously wanting because it relied solely on a role model theory.  \b0 \i \ul0 Wygant, supra,\b0 \i0 \ul0  106 S. Ct. at 1848. Implicit in the use of the role model theory was reliance on the raw use of statistics.  When these statistics were closely scrutinized by this Court it concluded that there was no additional evidence to show that the disparity between the percentage of minority students and the percentage of minority faculty was the result of prior discrimination by the Board. \b0 \i \ul0 Id.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 1848 (opinion by Powell, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and Rehnquist, J.); see also, \b0 \i \ul0 Id.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 1854 (O'Connor, J., concurring in the judgment).  In essence, the factual support for the Richmond Plan was far more probative than that revealed in \b0 \i \ul0 Wygant.\b0 \i0 \ul0  Thus, the factual predicate established by the Richmond City Council was more than adequate to support the adoption of the Richmond Plan.  Indeed, the facts revealed by the Richmond City Council are inapposite to \b0 \i \ul0 Wygant,\b0 \i0 \ul0  and therefore rob the court of appeals' decision of any basis for support.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 B.  The holding below unnecessarily imposes \b \i0 \ul0 [*29]\b0 \i0 \ul0   on every legislative body seeking to voluntarily remedy racial discrimination the same fact finding standards as are imposed on judicial and administrative bodies, and therefore strains the balance of powers between the judicial and legislative bodies of government at every level.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 While the Fourth Circuit acknowledges that the Richmond City Council should not be held to as rigorous a findings standard as a federal district court, its evaluation of the City Council's findings suggests otherwise. n31 How the court of appeals evaluated the Richmond City Council's findings dramatically illustrates the imposition of judicial standards on a legislative body.  This judicial imposition is, beyond question, an encroachment upon the legislative branch and can only lead to severe disruption of the balance of power between the judiciary and legislature.  See \b0 \i \ul0 Fullilove, supra,\b0 \i0 \ul0  448 U.S. at 503 (Powell, J., concurring).  This is particularly true in the area of race conscious remedies where the coordination of the branches at every level of government is extremely critical.  This concern was not lost on Justice Powell in \b0 \i \ul0 Fullilove.\b0 \i0 \ul0

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In \b0 \i \ul0 Fullilove,\b0 \i0 \ul0  the petitioners contended that the legislative history of the Public Works Employment Act of 1977 ("PWEA") reflected no findings of statutory or constitutional violations.  \b0 \i \ul0 Id.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 502.  In response, Justice Powell said:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Congress is not an adjudicatory body called upon to resolve specific disputes between competing adversaries.  Its constitutional role is to be representative rather than impartial, to make policy rather than to apply settled principles of law.  The petitioners' contention that this Court should treat the debates on Sec. 103(f)(2) as the complete "record" of congressional decision making underlying that statute is essentially a plea that we treat Congress as if it were a lower federal court.  But Congress is not expected to act as though it were duty bound to find facts and make conclusions of law.  The creation of national rules for the governance of our society simply does not entail the same concept of record-making that is appropriate to a judicial or administrative proceeding.  Congress has no responsibility to confine its vision to the facts and evidence adduced by particular parties.  Instead, its special attribute as a legislative body \b \i0 \ul0 [*31]\b0 \i0 \ul0   lies in its broader mission to investigate and consider all facts and opinions that may be relevant to the resolution of an issue.  \b0 \i \ul0 Id.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 502-03.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 He further states:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Acceptance of petitioners' argument would force Congress to make specific factual findings with respect to each legislative action.  Such a requirement would mark an unprecedented imposition of adjudicatory procedures upon a coordinate branch of Government.  Neither the Constitution nor our democratic tradition warrants such a constraint on the legislative process.  I therefore conclude that we are not confined in this case to an examination of the legislative history of Sec. 103 (f) (2) alone.  Rather, we properly may examine the total contemporary record of congressional action dealing with the problems of racial discrimination against minority business enterprises.  \b0 \i \ul0 Id.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 503.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The significance of Justice Powell's view is that he also recognized the evils in allowing courts to encroach upon the legislative fact finding process.  And, while his opinion in \b0 \i \ul0 Fullilove\b0 \i0 \ul0  may at first glance appear limited to Congress, upon closer scrutiny it appears to reflect a belief that legislative bodies are more \b \i0 \ul0 [*32]\b0 \i0 \ul0   competent than courts in making findings of broad-scale discrimination.  The proposition that courts should give deference to legislative findings is not without some basis in precedent. n32 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n32 See, Comment, \b0 \i \ul0 The Constitutionality of Affirmative Action in Public Employment: Judicial Deference to Certain Politically Responsible Bodies, supra\b0 \i0 \ul0  (the thrust of the Comment is that under Justice Powell's analysis of equal protection, courts should defer to findings of discrimination by legislative bodies who are accountable to the electorate, but should scrutinize findings of discrimination by isolated public bodies).  Cf.  Notes, \b0 \i \ul0 A Madisonian Interpretation of the Equal Protection Doctrine,\b0 \i0 \ul0  91 Yale L.J. 1403 (1982) (the Note essentially agrees with the idea of judicial deference to findings of discrimination by Congress, but would apply a stricter standard of scrutiny on state and local governments, respectively, on the theory that the federal government is a better protector of minority rights than lower levels of government).  See, e.g., \b0 \i \ul0 Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Co.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  449 U.S. 456, 470 (1981) ("it is not the function of the courts to substitute their evaluation of legislative facts for that of the legislature").  See also, \b0 \i \ul0 Id.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 468-70. But, see \b0 \i \ul0 Id.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 478 n.2 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  Politically responsible legislative bodies are better suited to correcting broad-scale discrimination than courts for two reasons: First, broad-scale societal discrimination is often not provable according to judicial standards.  Second, the number of parties involved in a determination of prior widespread discrimination would impose a strain on court procedures: even a class action lawsuit might be difficult to conduct, and furthermore, a class action would not be proper if individual claims differed widely.  See, \b0 \i \ul0 Vance v. Bradley,\b0 \i0 \ul0  440 U.S. 93, 111 (1979); \b0 \i \ul0 Day-Brite Lighting, Inc. v. Missouri,\b0 \i0 \ul0  342 U.S. 421, 425 (1952). See also, \b0 \i \ul0 Local 35, IBEW v. City of Hartford,\b0 \i0 \ul0  625 F.2d 416 (2nd Cir. 1980) (the Sixth Circuit upheld an affirmative action ordinance adopted by the City Council of Hartford, Connecticut).  \b0 \i \ul0 Cf.  \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Detroit Police Officers' Association v. Young,\b0 \i0 \ul0  608 F.2d 671 (6th Cir. 1979), \b0 \i \ul0 cert. denied,\b0 \i0 \ul0  452 U.S. 938 (1981) (the court of appeals rejected the district court's failure to accept the findings of minority under-representation by a Board of Police Commissioners).

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Justice Powell's concern for maintaining a balance between the judiciary and the legislative branch was not lost on other members of this Court.  Even more important than the respect accorded the legislature by this Court, however, is the constitutional principle of the separation of powers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Constitution does not require a legislature to conduct hearings, build a record, and make formal findings when it passes a law.  \b0 \i \ul0 Perez v. United States,\b0 \i0 \ul0  402 U.S. 146, 156-157 (1971); \b0 \i \ul0 Oregon v. Mitchell,\b0 \i0 \ul0  400 U.S. 112, 147 (1970) (Douglas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); \b0 \i \ul0 Katzenbach v. McClung,\b0 \i0 \ul0  379 U.S. 244, 299 (1964); \b0 \i \ul0 Carmichael v. Southern Coal & Coke Co.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  301 U.S. 495 (1937); \b0 \i \ul0 Bi-Metallic Investment Co. v. State Board of Equalization,\b0 \i0 \ul0  239 U.S. 441 (1915) (Holmes, J.).  The rule derives from basic separation of powers principles embodied in the Constitution.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This Court has uniformly held that a statute "will not be set aside if any state of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify it." \b0 \i \ul0 McGowan v. Maryland,\b0 \i0 \ul0  366 U.S. 420, 426 (1961); \b0 \i \ul0 James v. Strange,\b0 \i0 \ul0  407 U.S. 128, 133 (1972). \b \i0 \ul0 [*34]\b0 \i0 \ul0   In the absence of any legislative history, both the existence of facts supporting the legislature's judgment and its awareness of those facts will be presumed.  \b0 \i \ul0 United States v. Carolene Products Co.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  304 U.S. 144, 152 (1938); \b0 \i \ul0 Carmichael, supra,\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 509-10. Indeed, even if the resulting statute is constitutionally supportable, and the legislative history or other evidence indicate that Congress may have acted for improper reasons, this Court found it to be constitutionally irrelevant. n33 While this Court has not necessarily adhered to these long standing principles when addressing suspect classifications it has not totally disregarded the rationale underlying the principles.  In essence, these cases establish a principle that as long as a legislative body acts within the scope of its constitutional powers it is not the province of this Court to instruct it on the kind of hearings it must hold or the "findings" it must make.  As such Amici submits that where race conscious remedial legislation is involved, deference should remain the rule until a party can prove that it has been impermissibly discriminated against by the legislation.  In this instant \b \i0 \ul0 [*35]\b0 \i0 \ul0   the appellee failed to establish on all levels impermissable discrimination.  See, \b0 \i \ul0 Wyant, supra,\b0 \i0 \ul0  106 S. Ct. at 1853-54. By placing the initial burden on the legislature, however, the decision below allows for groundless claims to stifle the legislative process, and involves the courts in legislative judgments. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n33 See, e.g., \b0 \i \ul0 United States v. O'Brien,\b0 \i0 \ul0  391 U.S. 367, 383-84 (1968) ("Inquiries into congressional motives or purposes are a hazardous matter.  When the issue is simply the interpretation of legislation, the Court will look to statements by legislators for guidance as to the purpose of the legislation. . . .  It is entirely a different matter when we are asked to void a statute that is, under well-settled criteria, constitutional on its face, on the basis of what fewer than a handful of Congressmen said about it."); \b0 \i \ul0 Barenblatt v. United States,\b0 \i0 \ul0  360 U.S. 109, 132 (1959) ("So long as Congress acts in pursuance of its constitutional power, the Judiciary lacks authority to intervene on the basis of the motives which spurred the exercise of that power").
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 While the judgments of Congress, as opposed to those of a city council \b \i0 \ul0 [*36]\b0 \i0 \ul0   or a state legislature, are accorded particular deference, courts do not have carte blanche authority to second-guess state and local legislative judgments.  \b0 \i \ul0 Vance, supra;\b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0  \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Ferguson v. Skrupa,\b0 \i0 \ul0  372 U.S. 726 (1963) \b0 \i \ul0 Day-Brite, supra.\b0 \i0 \ul0  Judicial restraint in the review of state or local statutes or ordinances follows naturally from the realization that courts are not representative bodies.  \b0 \i \ul0 Alfange, supra,\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 640-41).  As Justice Frankfurter noted, courts "are not designed to be a good reflex of a democratic society." \b0 \i \ul0 Dennis v. United States,\b0 \i0 \ul0  341 U.S. 494, 525 (1951) (Frankfurter, J., concurring).  See also, L. Hand, \b0 \i \ul0 The Bill of Rights,\b0 \i0 \ul0  11-18 (1958); A. Bickel, \b0 \i \ul0 The Least Dangerous Branch\b0 \i0 \ul0  (1962).  In reviewing civil rights legislation, this Court has often recognized the competence of state or local governments to make findings with respect to the effects of identified past discrimination and its discretionary authority to take appropriate remedial measures.  \b0 \i \ul0 Johnson, supra;\b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0  Paradise, supra; \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Bakke, supra\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 302 n.41 (Powell, J.); \b0 \i \ul0 Katzenbach v.

United States,\b0 \i0 \ul0  379 U.S. 241 (1964).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Respect for the democratic process and the separation of powers is not the only reason courts do not require legislatures to hold hearings or make detailed findings:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The principle [of separation of power] is not merely one of deference to Congress or the states.  It rests upon appreciation of the fact that the fundamental basis for legislative action is the knowledge, experience, and judgment of the people's representatives only a small part, or even none, of which may come from the hearings and reports of committees or debates upon the floor.  Cox, \b0 \i \ul0 The Supreme Court, 1965 Term-Forward: Constitutional Adjudication and the Promotion of Human Rights,\b0 \i0 \ul0  80 Harv. L. Rev. 91, 105 (1966).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Legislatures are not courts.  Courts develop law through reason derived from precedent.  They are a reactive body, deciding only those cases and controversies before them on the basis of a record generally supplied by the parties.  Legislatures, by contrast, create laws through a process of bargaining and compromise.  They are by their very nature \b \i0 \ul0 [*38]\b0 \i0 \ul0   a diverse body whose task it is to make laws that may not please members of the judiciary or the public, but stand nonetheless as expressions of the will of the electorate.  A legislature acts affirmatively, drawing information and ideas not merely from hearings, debates, and committee reports but also from constituents, interest groups, and the executive branch.  Fisher, \b0 \i \ul0 Constitutional Interpretation By Members of Congress,\b0 \i0 \ul0  63 N.C.L. Rev. 707 (1985). "In the nature of the case [a legislature] cannot record a complete catalog of the considerations which move its members to enact laws." \b0 \i \ul0 Carmichael, supra,\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 301 U.S. at 510.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Lumping legislative determinations with administrative and judicial findings is therefore inappropriate.  Legislative bodies cannot be expected to conduct themselves like courts because they were not created to function as such.  \b0 \i \ul0 Fullilove, supra,\b0 \i0 \ul0  448 U.S. at 503 (Powell, J., concurring).  Imposing judicial formalities upon legislatures will not insure the integrity of legislation.  Requiring a state or local government to produce detailed findings prior to enacting legislation could only result \b \i0 \ul0 [*39]\b0 \i0 \ul0   in undesired consequences.  Amici believe that one of the side-effects of the court of appeals' decision is that it will force legislatures to focus attention and financial resources on the preparation of legislative findings, rather than more careful consideration of the text of pending legislation.  Such detailed findings can only lead to more involvement of the courts in trying to ascertain the genuineness of the legislation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Justice Powell concluded in \b0 \i \ul0 Fullilove,\b0 \i0 \ul0  that requiring Congress to make more specific findings would put an unwarranted "constraint on the legislative process." \b0 \i \ul0 Id.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 503. This Court and various scholars have on numerous occasions recognized the need for maintaining a balance between the judicial and legislative branches.  Karst, \b0 \i \ul0 Legislative Facts in Constitutional Litigation,\b0 \i0 \ul0  Supreme Court Review 75 (1960).  This respect for separation of powers principles and concern for burdening the legislative process was entirely lost on the court of appeals.
