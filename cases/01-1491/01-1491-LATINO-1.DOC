Our members are the family members of lawful permanent residents who face deportation. Mandatory detention does incalculable injury to our families, separating parents from children and depriving our family members of essential income and emotional support.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\b0 \i0 \ul0  \b \i0 \ul0 [**9]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Our loved ones, clients and community members detained under \'a7 1226(c) are lawful permanent residents and often have been for most of their lives. Many of the people most affected by the absence of those detained are U.S. citizens. n3 Mandatory detention results in a loss of  \b \i0 \ul0 [*5]\b0 \i0 \ul0   liberty that is total and severe, often as great as or greater than the punishment imposed for past criminal convictions. The full weight of mandatory detention is brought to bear by a mere preliminary assessment of deportability even though many of those detained ultimately establish that they are not removable as charged or win relief from removal. Detention under \'a7 1226(c) impairs the ability of countless others who may have similarly meritorious claims to obtain counsel and present their cases. Those who concede deportability are prevented from tying up their affairs and making preparations with their families for their departure, to the detriment of the wider community.

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Amici know from experience that \b \i0 \ul0 [**10]\b0 \i0 \ul0   detention throughout the complex process of determining removability is not the minimal and determinate imposition on liberty that the government claims it to be. Nor are existing mechanisms adequate to prevent the prolonged detention of people who do not in fact present a risk of flight or a danger to their communities. In cases where federal court intervention or other factors have allowed individualized findings to be made, many of those subject to \'a7 1226(c) have shown that they merit release. Amici seek a ruling from this Court that each individual be accorded the same opportunity.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 I. Mandatory detention impinges on the fundamental liberty interests of those detained and their families, imposing burdens on people who do not pose a flight risk or danger and pressuring those detained to abandon meritorious claims to relief\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Mandatory detention disrupts every facet of a person's life. Most lawful permanent residents subjected to \'a7 1226(c) have lives firmly established in the U.S. Time  \b \i0 \ul0 [*6]\b0 \i0 \ul0   spent in detention tears them away from their families, prevents them from working, running businesses, and attending school, and subjects them to onerous prison \b \i0 \ul0 [**11]\b0 \i0 \ul0   conditions. Although immigration charges are civil, those detained suffer a total loss of liberty.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 * \b \i0 \ul0 Elanith Valansi\b0 \i0 \ul0  endured nearly a year of mandatory detention under \'a7 1226(c) before the Third Circuit Court of Appeals held that a single conviction for embezzlement was not a deportable offense. The day after she was taken into INS custody, her father, age fifty-six, died of a heart attack. She was only permitted to attend the funeral in handcuffs while guarded by seven INS agents wearing bulletproof vests, was kept in a separate room from her father's casket, and was prohibited from participating in the ritual throwing of dirt on the coffin. Family and friends were forbidden from coming within fifty feet of her to offer condolences, and the rabbi was prevented from approaching her to say a prayer. Ms. Valansi, born in Israel, arrived in the U.S. in 1974 when she was six weeks old and became a lawful permanent resident in 1990. Her parents, siblings and step-siblings are U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. n4

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Mandatory detention imposes this deprivation of liberty on people \b \i0 \ul0 [**12]\b0 \i0 \ul0   who have already shown that they are not dangerous. Many people held under \'a7 1226(c) were never incarcerated n5 or served only short sentences. For example, Ansar Mahmood pled guilty to harboring an alien as a result of helping his sister's friends rent an apartment. He was sentenced to no jail time. However, as  \b \i0 \ul0 [*7]\b0 \i0 \ul0   of July, he had been held in INS mandatory detention for seven months. See Steve Orr, Local Lock-Up Plays Global Role, Rochester Democrat and Chronicle, July 21, 2002, at 6A. n6 Others have been released after criminal trial and permitted to surrender themselves to serve their sentences, or have otherwise proven themselves not to be flight risks. At his third hearing before an immigration judge, Dhonovan Serrano was informed that he should have been taken into mandatory detention upon release from criminal incarceration. The judge gave him three days to make arrangements, and Mr. Serrano complied, surrendering himself to INS. Prior to his surrender, he had driven from his home in Arizona to Dallas, Texas three times to attend removal hearings.  Serrano v. Estrada, 201 F. Supp. 2d 714, 716 (N.D. Tex. 2002). n7

See In re West, 22 I. & N. Dec. 1405, 1407-08, 1410 (BIA 2000).

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Individuals and families suffer acutely from the separation imposed by mandatory detention. Many are taken into INS custody months or years after serving \b \i0 \ul0 [**14]\b0 \i0 \ul0   their sentences, resulting in massive disruption to their and  \b \i0 \ul0 [*8]\b0 \i0 \ul0   their family members' lives. n8 Further, INS can move detained individuals hundreds or thousands of miles away from their homes.

INS moved her back to Alaska only after being ordered to do so by a federal judge. Throughout her removal proceedings, Ms. Said asserted that she was a U.S. citizen, a claim subsequently recognized by the State Department. Despite this assertion, she spent six months in \'a7 1226(c) detention for a drug conviction for which she had served thirty days. She gave birth just over a month after the conclusion of her proceedings. Ms. Said, born in Yemen, came to the U.S. in 1978, when she was one year old.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360  \b \i0 \ul0 [*9]\b0 \i0 \ul0   The combined weight of long separation from family, loss of income, and the prospect of extended confinement exerts enormous pressures on those mandatorily detained to forego or abandon meritorious defenses to removal. In 1999 and 2000, amicus the Florence Project identified twenty-four cases of detained clients who could contest their removability pursuant to a conviction for driving under the influence (DUI) under Arizona or California law. The controlling legal issue was on appeal from the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) to the Ninth Circuit and other circuit courts around the country. Faced with the prospect of mandatory detention during the pendency of their appeals, only fourteen of the eligible clients felt able to press their claims before the BIA. Of these, five abandoned their appeals before the BIA gave decisions in their cases. Seven more gave up before the circuit court ruled. Only two clients remained in detention to benefit from the Ninth Circuit's decision in United States v. Trinidad-Aquino, 259 F.3d 1140 (9th Cir. 2001) holding that their DUI convictions were not aggravated felonies for immigration purposes. Ultimately, the BIA acceded to \b \i0 \ul0 [**17]\b0 \i0 \ul0   the mounting consensus among the courts of appeals, reversing its prior precedent on DUI convictions.  In re Ramos, 23 I. & N. Dec. 336 (BIA 2002). But this was all too late for the lawful permanent residents unable to bear continued detention. n10

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The government insists that persons subject to mandatory detention under \'a7 1226(c) have committed crimes that "terminate their entitlement to remain in the United States," Pet. Br. at 11, and therefore have no significant liberty interest in being free from detention. But whether a person will be stripped of lawful permanent resident status and removed is determined at the end of proceedings, not at the outset. 8 U.S.C. \'a7 1101(a)(20) (2000); 8 C.F.R. \'a7 1.1(p) (2002). As the experiences of our family and community members and clients make clear, it is frequently impossible to determine whether someone is removable \b \i0 \ul0 [**18]\b0 \i0 \ul0   without careful and thorough adjudication in removal proceedings or in the federal courts. Nonetheless, persons charged as removable under \'a7 1226(c) remain locked up without any opportunity to show that they are not a danger or a flight risk.

The immigration judge eventually affirmed his claim, and the BIA rejected the government's appeal. Mr. Van Eeten spent nearly five months in \'a7 1226(c) detention before a district court judge ordered that he be provided with a bond hearing. Had the court not struck down \'a7 1226(c), Mr. Van Eeten would have been  \b \i0 \ul0 [*11]\b0 \i0 \ul0   detained while he pursued his case before the immigration judge and defended against the government's \b \i0 \ul0 [**19]\b0 \i0 \ul0   appeal.

As Mr. Van Eeten's case illustrates, questions can arise concerning the naturalization process itself. In addition, whether a person derived citizenship from the naturalization of a parent under 8 U.S.C. \'a7 1431 or former \'a7 1432 (repealed 2000) depends on issues such as what constitutes legal custody, see Fierro v. Reno, 217 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2000), legal separation, see Moussa v. INS, 302 F.3d 823, 824 (8th Cir. 2002), or divorce, see Said v. Eddy, 87 F. Supp. 2d 937, 938 (D. Alaska 2000). Acquisition of citizenship at birth under 8 U.S.C. \'a7 1401(g) may revolve around questions of \b \i0 \ul0 [**20]\b0 \i0 \ul0   legitimation, requiring the analysis of state laws or laws of other countries. See, e.g., Wedderburn v. INS, 215 F.3d 795, 799 (7th Cir. 2000) (noting possible effect of Jamaican law of child custody on citizenship claim); Alexander v. INS, No. Civ. 96-147- P-C, 1997 WL 97114, at *1-2 (D. Me. Feb. 27, 1997) (whether petitioner had become a citizen when his father naturalized determined by Maine legitimation law). None of these legal and factual questions can be resolved by looking at the charging document.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 It is often less than clear how a person's criminal convictions should be classified under immigration law. These classifications depend on complex and fact-sensitive interactions between immigration law, federal criminal statutes, and the criminal statutes of each of the fifty states. The result is that many lawful permanent residents are able to demonstrate during the course of their removal hearings that their crimes do not make them deportable.

Seven months later, the Seventh Circuit found that it met neither definition, admonishing that "the INS . . . would be well advised to look at the charging papers in order to ensure that [basic elements of the relevant federal definition] are satisfied before it initiates the serious ramifications of removal proceedings based on an alleged 'burglary offense.'" n13

Classification of given crimes as aggravated felonies is a particularly unsettled area of immigration law, requiring \b \i0 \ul0 [**22]\b0 \i0 \ul0   comparison of widely varying state statutes to federal definitions and often requiring an examination of analogy to federal criminal offenses. n14 The same uncertainty hangs over those charged as having been convicted of a "crime involving moral turpitude" (CIMT) under 8 U.S.C. \'a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii), a term with no statutory definition. See Jordan v. DeJorge, 341 U.S. 223 (1951).

Some states have statutes requiring criminal court judges to advise defendants that they may face \b \i0 \ul0 [**26]\b0 \i0 \ul0   removal if they are not citizens; the criminal court will sometimes vacate a plea entered in violation of these requirements. n17 When a conviction is vacated by a state court for legal error, it no longer remains a valid ground for removal.

Approximately ninety percent of INS detainees go through proceedings without representation. Elizabeth Amon, INS Fails to See the Light, Nat'l L.J., Mar. 5, 2001, at A1. The detention facilities INS utilizes are not necessarily located \b \i0 \ul0 [**34]\b0 \i0 \ul0   in areas with lawyers willing and qualified to represent persons in detention. In addition to the eighteen INS run or contracted detention facilities, INS utilizes approximately 1,940 state prisons and county jails spread throughout the country to house over fifty percent of INS detainees. n22 Detention also prevents detainees from earning an income, creating further complications to retaining legal counsel. See 8 U.S.C. \'a7 1229a(b)(4)(A) (2000) (respondents in removal proceedings have "the privilege of being represented, at no expense to the Government"). This translates into forced reliance on the scarce resources of the few public interest  \b \i0 \ul0 [*21]\b0 \i0 \ul0   organizations and pro bono attorneys representing immigrants in detention for criminal offenses. But most detention facilities are not located near such organizations or attorneys, and those that do exist are minimal in comparison to the need.

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Proving that one is not removable frequently involves complex legal analysis. For example, determining whether a crime is a removable offense involves comparing and contrasting state and federal statutes and parsing statutory provisions into their various subparts. In the case of Mr. Solorzano-Patlan, discussed supra p. 12, the Seventh Circuit analyzed his burglary conviction by comparing the particular provision in the Illinois statute to which he pled guilty \b \i0 \ul0 [**36]\b0 \i0 \ul0   with a generic definition of burglary, and criticized the immigration judge for only looking at the title of the state statute, rather than the particular characteristics of the statutory offense.

Citizenship claims can involve examining state civil laws  \b \i0 \ul0 [*22]\b0 \i0 \ul0   and the laws of foreign countries regarding legitimation procedures, legal separation, divorce, and custody. In Ms. Said's case, discussed supra p. 8, citizenship turned solely on whether her parents were divorced according to Yemeni law. Given this complexity, those without lawyers are acutely hampered in their ability to protect their status.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Applications for relief are also factually complex, requiring both extensive documentation and witnesses. Mandatory detention interferes with a person's ability to obtain either. Winning cancellation of removal or \'a7 1182(c) relief depends heavily on one's ability to present sufficient positive equities, including family ties, length of time in the U.S., hardship should deportation occur, service in this country's Armed Forces, employment history, property or business ties, evidence of value and service to the community, proof of genuine rehabilitation, and other evidence attesting to one's good character, such as affidavits from family, friends, and community representatives.  In re C-V-T-, 22 I. & N. Dec. 7, 11 (BIA 1998). Making this showing entails contacting a variety of administrative agencies, private employers, friends, and family members in order to obtain letters, records, affidavits, and other documents. In addition, applicants must sift through the papers, receipts, and records that have accumulated over many years. Respondents in removal proceedings have a right to present evidence on their behalf, 8 C.F.R. \'a7 240.10(a)(4) (2002), but when they are detained,  \b \i0 \ul0 [**38]\b0 \i0 \ul0   particularly if the  \b \i0 \ul0 [*23]\b0 \i0 \ul0   facility is far from their family and community, applicants may be unable to exercise this right.

But he was soon transferred to a detention facility in rural Arizona, one hour's drive from an airport and inaccessible by public transportation. The immigration judge denied his cancellation application, finding that Mr. N had "not submitted any documentation to show his employment history but [merely] stated his employment history in his application along with the fact that he says he filed tax returns for a number of years in the United States." The judge also noted the absence of family members testifying on Mr. N's behalf. Because he was detained, Mr. N had been unable to obtain letters and other documentation of his work and tax history. Further, Mr. N's family could not afford plane tickets to attend the proceedings. He appealed to the BIA, which found that the immigration judge had erred and ordered a rehearing, and on remand the judge granted \b \i0 \ul0 [**39]\b0 \i0 \ul0   cancellation. Mr. N spent over eleven months in mandatory detention. n25

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The government argues that mandatory detention under \'a7 1226(c) is not "indefinite" because it applies only during the pendency of removal proceedings. Pet. Br. at  \b \i0 \ul0 [*24]\b0 \i0 \ul0   40. The government further argues that this detention is a minimal imposition because removal proceedings before immigration judges are completed in an average time of forty-seven days and a median time of thirty days. See id. at 39. Any period of detention under \'a7 1226(c) is a total loss of liberty unjustified by a finding of the individual's danger to the community or flight risk. But the statistics are also misleading, presenting averages that are by no means typical of a case where a detained respondent seeks relief from deportation or contests removability. In such \b \i0 \ul0 [**40]\b0 \i0 \ul0   cases, proceedings before the immigration judge may stretch into the hundreds of days. See, e.g., Amaye v. Elwood, 01- CV-2177, 2002 WL 1747540 (M.D. Pa. June 17, 2002) (proceedings before immigration judge lasted 276 days). n26 The cases discussed in Part II supra demonstrate that removal proceedings can be extremely complex and that vindication of meritorious claims necessarily takes time.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 INS' policy of moving those detained under \'a7 1226(c) often delays the beginning of removal proceedings. Even  \b \i0 \ul0 [*25]\b0 \i0 \ul0   where a detainee is held in one place, proceedings before the immigration judge take considerable time. Where removal is contested, immigration proceedings have multiple stages: pleadings at which the respondent concedes to or challenges the factual allegations in the charging document, judicial findings on removability, submission of applications for relief, and adjudication of those claims. Most of the preliminary stages are conducted at separate "master calendar" hearings that can be days or months apart.

\par \fs20 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 B. Hearings addressing the applicability of \'a7 1226(c) are an inadequate mechanism to redress the statute's broad reach\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The government contends that \'a7 1226(c) contains adequate procedural safeguards because individuals detained under \'a7 1226(c) can seek a hearing on whether  \b \i0 \ul0 [*27]\b0 \i0 \ul0   they properly fall within the statute. Pet. Br. at 26. This argument misapprehends the constitutional defect in mandatory detention, which is the lack of an individualized inquiry into the dangerousness and flight risk posed by a detainee. But even where the government's classification of a given detainee under \'a7 1226(c) is in question, this mechanism does not provide a meaningful remedy to wrongful detention. To qualify for a bond, individuals \b \i0 \ul0 [**44]\b0 \i0 \ul0   must show that the government is substantially unlikely to prevail on the claim that they are removable under a category listed in \'a7 1226(c). See In re Joseph, 22 I. & N. Dec. 799, 806 (BIA 1999). Immigration judges are bound to follow precedent decisions of the BIA, 8 C.F.R. \'a7 3.1(g) (2002), even though the BIA revisits its own views on these classifications with some frequency, see, e.g., In re Yanez-Garcia, 23 I. & N. Dec. 390 (BIA 2002) (reversing In re K-V-D-, 22 I. & N. Dec. 1163 (BIA 1999)). Making facial assessments on which arguments may prevail is difficult in this unsettled area of the law. Even the BIA appears to have difficulty in making these assessments.

Joseph Okeke, whose case is discussed supra p. 17, was granted a hearing on the propriety of his mandatory detention on July 20, 1999, sixteen days after he was detained. The immigration judge determined that he was properly held under \'a7 1226(c) notwithstanding his argument that his conviction, a first offense, did not meet the federal definition of a conviction for purposes of removability. His appeal of this determination was filed on July 26, 1999 and was still pending five months later, when he was granted cancellation of removal and released. See Lodging at L-6; see also Thomas v. Reno, No. 00-3493, slip op. (D.N.J. Oct. 11, 2001) (BIA decision on custody status rendered \b \i0 \ul0 [**46]\b0 \i0 \ul0   approximately six months after IJ determination); In re Rojas, 23 I. & N. Dec. 117 (BIA 2001) (decision rendered 215 days after IJ determination); Joseph, 22 I. & N. Dec. at 799 (decision rendered 106 days after IJ determination). Such hearings thus do not represent an adequate "safety valve," even on the limited issues they address.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 More fundamentally, the hearing that is provided to those detained under \'a7 1226(c) does not address the critical issue: whether an individual poses a flight risk or a danger to the community. In cases where those subject to detention under \'a7 1226(c) have been granted bond hearings--either through federal court intervention or for other reasons--it becomes abundantly clear that many in fact represent little or no flight risk or danger.

The immigration judge did not consider the second crime to constitute a CIMT and set the minimum permitted bond of $ 1,500. INS did not appeal from this low bond, which Mr. Molina's family was able to post the same day. Several weeks later, when \b \i0 \ul0 [**47]\b0 \i0 \ul0   INS issued new charging papers asserting that the same conviction  \b \i0 \ul0 [*29]\b0 \i0 \ul0   was an aggravated felony, INS re-arrested Mr. Molina. The immigration judge denied bond pursuant to \'a7 1226(c). No new facts concerning Mr. Molina's flight risk or dangerousness were adduced at the second custody hearing. The only thing that had changed was his re-classification as an aggravated felon for the same underlying conduct. n31

As noted, outside of detention, he successfully prosecuted his claim to citizenship. Lodging at L-4. Rayford Gill, a citizen of Belize and lawful resident since 1994, won a similar challenge and was granted a $ 5,000 bond. He has left detention and is currently pursuing his claim that he is not removable for his single offense of drug possession. See Gill v. Ashcroft, No. 01 C 9789, 2002 WL 1163729, at *1, *6 (N.D.

The arbitrariness of this classification, and its irrelevance to flight risk and danger, was brought into even sharper relief when Mr. Molina's sentence was subsequently vacated, rendering him no longer an aggravated felon. See id. Perhaps even more illogically, \'a7 1226(c) prevents any possibility of release even for individuals who, if they abandoned claims to relief from removal, would clearly qualify for release under this Court's recent ruling in Zadvydas v.

See Chanthanounsy, 2002 WL 1477170, at *1-2; Lodging at L-24 (Laotian national held for two years pending an administrative appeal although the INS would have been presumptively obliged to release him had he not appealed his deportation).

Yet mandatory detention impedes their ability to answer the charges against them and forecloses any individualized consideration of risk of flight or dangerousness. Amici seek a ruling that these individuals be afforded the opportunity to demonstrate their fitness for release. For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed.
