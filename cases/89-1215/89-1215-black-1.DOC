\par \pard 
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 INTERESTS:\b0 \i0 \ul0  The NAACP LEGAL DEFENSE & EDUCATIONAL FUND, INC. ("LDF") is a national non-profit corporation formed to assist African Americans in the vindication of their constitutional and civil rights.  For many years LDF has pursued litigation to secure the basic civil and economic rights of low-income black families and individuals.  Intentional and unintentional employment practices which discriminate against African Americans have been a primary LDF concern.  LDF has also worked on behalf of African Americans struggling with the burden of poor health and discriminatory and inadequate health care services.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 INTEREST OF AMICI CURIAE
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 LDF is particularly concerned with the growing rates of poverty among African Americans and with the number of single female-headed African American families that are living in poverty.  Through its Poverty & Justice Program, LDF is challenging the barriers to economic advancement to help improve the economic status and living conditions of the many in poverty.  LDF's Black Women's Employment Program strives to remove obstacles to employment in occupations where African American women are underrepresented and to provide access to jobs with better wages, decent conditions, and pension and health benefits.  Currently, the majority of working African American women are employed in low-paying occupations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The NATIONAL BLACK WOMEN'S HEALTH PROJECT is a health, education and advocacy organization which works to improve the quality of life for African American women.  It works to promote non-discriminatory approaches to insure that all African American women have access to health services, including abortion, that maximize maternal health, reduce infant mortality and produce healthy babies.  Because poor African American women are particularly vulnerable to economic coercion, the impact of exclusionary policies may be particularly severe for them.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 TITLE: \b0 \i0 \ul0 BRIEF FOR THE NAACP LEGAL DEFENSE AND EDUCATIONAL FUND, INC., AND THE NATIONAL BLACK WOMEN'S HEALTH PROJECT AS AMICI CURIAE SUPPORTING PETITIONERS
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Amici, supporting petitioners, address two important issues: first, the applicability of settled distinctions in employment discrimination law to fetal protection policies; and second, the impact of such policies on African American workers and their children.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 First, it is well established that Title VII of the \b \i0 \ul0 [*6]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits two discrete types of employment discrimination: disparate treatment and disparate impact.  Employment policies that are discriminatory on their face -- that is, they distinguish individuals on the basis of their gender -- can be upheld by courts only under extraordinary circumstances: an employer must establish that sex is a BFOQ, a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular business or enterprise.  As this Court has recognized, the BFOQ was meant to be an extremely narrow exception to the general prohibition of discrimination on the basis of sex.  By contrast, cases of disparate impact, involving facially neutral policies or practices, can be answered by a claim of business necessity.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Fetal protection policies which exclude all fertile women from particular jobs in order to prevent possible damage to potential fetuses are facially discriminatory.  They classify job applicants and employees by gender and treat individuals differentially on the basis of that classification.  Such policies bar the employment of all women of child-bearing capacity, whether or not they are pregnant or contemplating \b \i0 \ul0 [*7]\b0 \i0 \ul0   pregnancy, but do not prohibit the employment of male workers whose reproductive health may also be damaged by workplace hazards.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Seventh Circuit's application of the business necessity defense to a facially discriminatory fetal protection policy was erroneous, as it blurred the essential difference between disparate treatment and disparate impact cases.  This case has the potential to disrupt settled analytic standards and to dilute legal protections against employment discrimination.  Employers with potentially hazardous work environments should not be allowed to deny employment opportunities to a class of workers who are believed to be at greater risk in a hazardous environment because of gender or genetic make-up, but, instead, should be required to protect the health and safety of all workers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Second, African American workers are overrepresented in industries and occupations that pose significant health and safety hazards.  Reductions in health and safety protections for workers, which that may result if employers are allowed to evade their responsibility to make workplaces safe for all employees, will disproportionately adversely effect African Americans.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Moreover,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*8]\b0 \i0 \ul0   exclusionary policies that restrict employment opportunities for all women will further limit access for low-income women to better-paying jobs, as well as their attendant health and pension benefit programs.  Most working poor, female single-headed families, a disproportionate number of whom are African American, face poverty and lack health coverage.  No barriers to improving the economic and health outlook of these families should be permitted.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 ARGUMENT
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 I.  AN EXPLICIT CLASSIFICATION BASED ON SEX AND THE CAPACITY TO HAVE CHILDREN IS NOT GENDER NEUTRAL AND CONSTITUTES DISPARATE TREATMENT
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 A.  The Distinct Types of Discriminatory Practices Proscribed in \'a7 703(a)
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Title VII forbids two types of employment discrimination.  The first, disparate treatment, both overt or facial and covert or pretextual, is prohibited by \'a7 703(a)(1) of Title VII. n1 "'Disparate treatment'. . . is the most easily understood type of discrimination.  The employer simply treats some people less favorably than others because of their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.'" International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 335 n.15 (1977). 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n1 The statutory proscription against discriminatory treatment states:
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer:
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 1.  to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin;
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 \'a7 703(a) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \'a7 2000e-2(a).
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  \b \i0 \ul0 [*9]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 "A disparate impact claim," on the other hand, "reflects the language of \'a7 703(a)(2)." n2 Connecticut v. Teal, 457 U.S. 440, 448 (1982). Claims of disparate impact "involve employment practices that are facially neutral in their treatment of different groups but that in fact fall more harshly on one group than another and cannot be justified by business necessity." Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 335 n. 15. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n2 The statutory proscription against discriminatory impact states:
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer:
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 2.  to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for employment in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 \'a7 703(a) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \'a7 2000e-2(a).
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Although the \'a7 703 framework evinces no intent to restrict plaintiffs to one of the two provisions as an exclusive remedy, n3 the statutory language clearly encompasses two distinct forms of discrimination: disparate treatment and disparate \b \i0 \ul0 [*10]\b0 \i0 \ul0   impact. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n3 Several lower courts have held that plaintiffs may also bring disparate impact challenges under \'a7 703(a)(1).  See, e.g., Colby v. J.C. Penney Co., 811 F.2d 1119, 1127 (7th Cir. 1987); Wambheim v. J.C. Penney Co., 705 F.2d 1492, 1494 (9th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 467 U.S. 1255 (1984); cf.  Nashville Gas Co. v. Satty, 434 U.S. 136, 144 (1977) (The Court "need not decide whether . . . it is necessary to prove intent to establish a prima facie violation of \'a7 703(a)(1).").
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Court has applied \'a7 703(a)(1) in a variety of circumstances involving disparate treatment.  See, e.g., Los Angeles Department of Water & Power v. Manhart, 435 U.S. 702 (1978) (direct evidence of a policy of disparate treatment); McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973) (individual disparate treatment); International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324 (1977) (pattern or practice of disparate treatment).  The standard for evidentiary analysis applied in these cases depends upon the existence of direct evidence of discriminatory treatment.  Where direct evidence is absent,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*11]\b0 \i0 \ul0   the plaintiff must establish a prima facie case through circumstantial evidence.  See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802. "The shifting burdens of proof set forth in McDonnell Douglas are designed to assure that the 'plaintiff [has] his day in court despite the unavailability of direct evidence.'" Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U.S. 111, 121 (1985) (quoting Loeb v. Textron, Inc., 600 F.2d 1003, 1014 (1st Cir. 1979)). By contrast, "the McDonnell Douglas test is inapplicable where the plaintiff presents direct evidence of discrimination." Thurston, 469 U.S. at 121.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 An employment policy or practice is established as facially discriminatory, without further need to show a discriminatory intent, where plaintiff's direct evidence of discrimination is accepted.  Arizona Governing Committee v. Norris, 463 U.S. 1073, 1084 (1983) (retirement plan paying lower benefits to women than to men is facially discriminatory); Manhart, 435 U.S. at 708 (policy requiring female employees to make larger contributions to pension fund than male employees is facially discriminatory); Phillips v. Martin Marietta Corp., 400 U.S. 542 (1971) \b \i0 \ul0 [*12]\b0 \i0 \ul0   (per curiam) (policy of hiring men but not women with pre-school age children is facially discriminatory); Thurston, 469 U.S. at 121 (policy conditioning transfer rights on age of airline captains is facially discriminatory).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 B.  An Employment Policy Which Explicitly Classifies Applicants and Employees According To Gender And Capacity To Have Children Is Facially Discriminatory Under \'a7\'a7 703(a)(1) and 701(k)
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 "Section 703(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires that persons of like qualifications be given employment opportunities irrespective of their sex." Phillips, 400 U.S. at 544. "It precludes treatment of individuals as simply components of a racial, religious, sexual, or national class." Manhart, 435 U.S. at 708.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Demonstration that an employer openly differentiates between male and female applicants or employees is direct evidence of discrimination.  As such, an employment policy which is written with an explicit reference to gender and applies to all individuals of one sex and not the other has always been held to be facially discriminatory.  See Norris, 463 U.S. at 1084 (benefit levels based on gender); Manhart, 435 U.S. at 708 \b \i0 \ul0 [*13]\b0 \i0 \ul0   (contribution requirement based on gender); Phillips, 400 U.S. at 544 (separate hiring policies for women having pre-school children and for men similarly situated).  As this Court has stated, "Practices that classify employees in terms of religion, race, or sex tend to preserve traditional assumptions about groups rather than thoughtful scrutiny of individuals." Manhart, 435 U.S. at 709.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 "Fetal protection policies," such as the hiring policy at issue in the present case, explicitly classify applicants and employees by gender.  These policies require that female applicants -- but not males -- offer proof of sterility.  Employers thus explicitly categorize prospective and current employees by sex despite abundant evidence that toxic exposure in the workplace poses a health hazard to the potential offspring of both male and female workers. n4 See 43 Fed.Reg. 52953, 52966 (1978) (Occupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA, finding that "male workers may be adversely effected [sic] by lead as well as women.  Male workers may be rendered infertile or impotent, and both men and women are subject to genetic damage which may affect both the \b \i0 \ul0 [*14]\b0 \i0 \ul0   course and outcome of pregnancy."); United Steelworkers of America, etc. v. Marshall, 647 F.2d 1189, 1257 (D.C. Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 453 U.S. 913 (1981) (OSHA found "abundant support" for view that lead exposure presents health risks to offspring of male and female workers and, thus, the standard for lead exposure must protect reproductive capacities of both sexes).  See also Staff of House Comm. on Ed. and Labor, 101st Cong., 2d Sess., Report on The EEOC, Title VII and Workplace Fetal Protection Policies in the 1980s, at 7-9 (Comm. Print 1990); Chris Winder, "Reproductive and Chromosomal Effects of Occupational Exposure to Lead in the Male," 3 Reproductive Toxicology 221 (1989). 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n4 In addition, employers justify the employment policy in a facially discriminatory way: the stated intention of the policy is to protect not only potential offspring but also "their mothers." The risk of harm to potential fathers is not granted similar consideration.  International Union, UAW v. Johnson Controls, Inc., 886 F.2d 871, at 884 n.25 (7th Cir. 1989).
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Employment policies that differentiate between males and females for the purpose of evaluating \b \i0 \ul0 [*15]\b0 \i0 \ul0   the risk of damage to potential offspring are based on unwarranted assumptions and stereotypes about class characteristics: such gender-based classifications are simultaneously underinclusive, since lead exposure increases reproductive risks for both male and female workers, and overbroad, by encompassing all female employees, even though most women in an industrial labor force do not become pregnant.  Johnson Controls, 886 F.2d at 913 (Easterbrook, J., dissenting).  These explicit gender-based policies are indeed founded upon discriminatory assumptions about the relevance of physical differences.  They improperly impute to every individual female generalizations about risks to fetal health posed by the class of females as a whole.  "Even a true generalization about the class is an insufficient reason for disqualifying an individual to whom the generalization does not apply." Manhart, 435 U.S. at 708.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In 1978, Congress amended the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to clarify its intent that gender distinctions based on "pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions" are also prohibited by Title VII.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 \'a7 701(k) of Title VII provides, in part:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The terms "because \b \i0 \ul0 [*16]\b0 \i0 \ul0   of sex" or "on the basis of sex" include, but are not limited to, because of or on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions, and women affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions shall be treated the same for all employment-related purposes . . . as other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to work . . . .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 42 U.S.C. \'a7 2000e(k) (emphasis added).  Congress thus established that differential treatment of pregnancy is gender-based discrimination.  Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co. v. EEOC, 462 U.S. 669 (1983). The legislative history of this amendment to Title VII makes clear that distinctions based on the childbearing capacity of women constitute sex discrimination.  H.R. Rep. 948, 95th Cong., 2nd Sess. at 2, 5, 6, reprinted in 1978 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News 4749, 4750, 4753, 4754.  Thus, explicit classifications based on the capacity to become pregnant, even though they are based on real physical differences between men and women, are proscribed by Title VII.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Despite the fact that Johnson Controls' fetal protection policy is facially discriminatory, the \b \i0 \ul0 [*17]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Seventh Circuit failed to apply the analytic framework appropriate for cases of disparate treatment.  The court's "flexible" approach to claims of overt discrimination, see Johnson Controls, 886 F.2d at 883, threatens to dilute protection against the most egregious forms of employment discrimination, including explicit classifications on the basis of race. n5 At least one major company has adopted a workplace screening and hiring policy that classified applicants and employees on the basis of race.  The rationale is analogous to that used for fetal protection policies: because of group differences, specifically a greater incidence of sickle cell trait, particular workplace hazards pose heightened risks to the health of African Americans.  Although it is generally accepted that the trait for sickle-cell anemia is harmless, the Du Pont Company adopted a policy designed to reduce health risks by screening all group members for the sickle cell trait and, then, by excluding all individuals with the trait from jobs involving exposure to hazardous substances.  See R. Severo, "The Genetic Barrier: Job Benefit or Job Bias," The New York Times Feb. 3, 4, 5, 6, 1980, reprinted 1980 \b \i0 \ul0 [*18]\b0 \i0 \ul0   by Womens Occupational Health Resources Center, Columbia Univ.  This Court should not countenance a decision which disregards the basic distinction between disparate treatment and disparate impact cases that has guided twenty-five years of Title VII jurisprudence and provided protection against employment policies that would classify individuals on the basis of group membership. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n5 Significantly, facial discrimination on the basis of race is simply impermissible: the BFOQ exception to the prohibition of such discrimination is not available to defend racial classifications.  See \'a7 703(e) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(e) (defense limited to "those certain instances where religion, sex, or national origin is a bona fide occupational qualification . . . .").  Application of the business necessity defense to claims of facial and intentional discrimination would turn the clock back on employment discrimination law by allowing a defense for explicit racial classifications.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 II.  STATUTORY LANGUAGE, THE STANDARD OF EVIDENTIARY ANALYSIS DEVELOPED BY THE COURT, AND ADMINISTRATIVE INTERPRETATION DEMONSTRATE THAT A CASE OF DISPARATE TREATMENT CAN ONLY BE OVERCOME \b \i0 \ul0 [*19]\b0 \i0 \ul0   BY THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A BONA FIDE OCCUPATIONAL QUALIFICATION
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Title VII prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender unless sex is a "bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular business or enterprise." \'a7 703(e) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(e).  The Bona Fide Occupational Qualification (BFOQ) "was in fact meant to be an extremely narrow exception to the general prohibition of discrimination on the basis of sex." Dothard v. Rawlinson, 433 U.S. 321, 334 (1977).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 When an employer asserts that gender is a bona fide occupational qualification, the employer has the burden of persuasion.  Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S.  , 104 L.Ed.2d 268, 287 (1989).  The employer must demonstrate, first, that the occupational qualification is "reasonably necessary to the normal operation of [the] particular business.  Second, "[t]he principle of nondiscrimination" requires that the employer show that "all or substantially all women would be unable to perform safely and efficiently the duties of the job involved." Weeks v. Southern Bell Telephone & Telegraph Co., 408 F.2d 228, 235 (5th Cir. 1969). \b \i0 \ul0 [*20]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Pregnancy Discrimination Act explicitly defined the standard to be applied in cases of gender discrimination involving the capacity of women to bear children: a showing of disparate treatment can be overcome only by a showing that female employees differ from others "in their ability or inability to work." \'a7 701(k) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. 2000e(k).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 By contrast, business necessity can be asserted to justify facially neutral practices that have an adverse impact on members of a protected class.  This Court recently stated the relevant query: "[in] a disparate impact case, the dispositive issue is whether a challenged practice serves, in a significant way, the legitimate employment goals of the employer." Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U.S.  , 104 L.Ed. 733, 752 (1989).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Business necessity has never been a defense to overt discrimination.  The Seventh Circuit's adoption of the business necessity defense in this case was an attempt to circumvent the requirements of the BFOQ defense.  The California Court of Appeal which also considered Johnson Controls' fetal protection policy expressly disagreed with and declined to follow the reasoning \b \i0 \ul0 [*21]\b0 \i0 \ul0   of the Seventh Circuit.  The state court properly found the employment policy facially discriminatory and concluded that only the BFOQ defense applied.  "The fact that it may be difficult for the employer to meet the BFOQ standard in a [fetal protection policy] situation is a concern of the legislature." Johnson Controls, Inc. v. California Fair Employment and Housing Commission, 218 Cal.App.3d 517 (1990) at 37.  To adopt the business necessity defense in this context is to "champion an analysis which holds that overt, facial discrimination creates only a presumption of discrimination." Id. at 39.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Administrative interpretation of Title VII also supports the position that only the demonstration of a BFOQ can overcome a case of disparate treatment.  An Equal Employment Opportunity Commission internal policy guidance issued after the Seventh Circuit's Johnson Controls decision stated that fetal protection policies which exclude only women constitute per se violations of Title VII. n6 "For the plaintiff to bear the burden of proof in a case in which there is direct evidence of a facially discriminatory policy is wholly inconsistent with settled Title VII law."

Print 1990), it is significant that on January 24, 1990, the Commission released a guidance in which it took issue with the Seventh Circuit's Johnson Controls decision and expressly instructed EEOC staff to disregard the court's opinion.  EEOC Policy Guidance on United Auto Workers v. Johnson Controls, Inc. Daily Lab. Rep. (BNA) No. 18, at D-1 (January 26, 1990).  This recent statement takes a clear position.  In contrast, the Commission's earlier guidance, quoted at length by the Seventh Circuit, was merely interpretive.  The 1988 guidance was limited to the elaboration of the framework suggested by existing judicial interpretations.  See EEOC Policy Guidance on Reproductive and Fetal Hazards Daily Lab. Rep.

The relaxation of standards allowed by the Seventh Circuit is a dangerous precedent - with consequences that extend well beyond the context of fetal protection policies.  Employment discrimination law prohibits, and should continue to prohibit, the wholesale exclusion of a class of people from the workplace.  Categorical exclusion cannot be justified by the belief that some individuals within the class may be particularly susceptible to the harmful effects of toxic substances.  Title VII does not allow employers to institute policies that sacrifice women's employment opportunities instead of cleaning dirty workplaces.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Lead exposure poses serious health hazards for workers, as well as for poor, urban children.  Found in paint, gasoline, food and food containers, lead causes disabling illness and brain damage, which can lead to lowered intelligence, erratic behavior and poor classroom performance in children.  A study of blood lead levels found that the mean levels of blood lead were higher in African Americans than whites across all ages.  It also found that within the central cities, the mean blood lead levels in African American children were significantly higher than in white children. n12 Eleven percent of all inner-city children, 12% of African American children and over 18% of poor African American children possess dangerous blood lead levels. n13

Programs to identify and provide medical help to affected children can check and even reverse the symptoms of lead poisoning.  During the 1970s several federally-funded programs addressed the problem of exposure to lead.

Regulatory agencies have abdicated their responsibility for protecting the lives and health of Americans, especially African American workers and families. n47 Without more balanced analysis, no significant improvement in the health indices of African Americans should be expected.

While 80.9 percent of white children in working moderate-income families had employer coverage in 1986, only 69.6 percent of comparably situated African American children were similarly protected. n61

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Having no health insurance places the existing children of African American working mothers in \b \i0 \ul0 [*45]\b0 \i0 \ul0   immediate peril.  In fact, this lack of coverage and access to care may be more harmful than the potential hazard to uncontemplated future offspring posed by working in a job which may involve exposure to hazardous substances.  Employers implementing fetal protection policies are trading off health risks and placing the health of existing children -- and the stability of their families -- in jeopardy.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 One measurement of the health of a nation is its infant mortality rate.

If the very slow overall rate of progress made during the 1978-1986 period continues until the year 2000, one out of every five births (and more than one-third of African American births) will be to a woman \b \i0 \ul0 [*46]\b0 \i0 \ul0   who failed to receive this crucial care early in pregnancy. n63 Children born to women who fail to receive prenatal care are three times more likely to die in infancy than those whose mothers receive comprehensive care.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 CONCLUSION
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This case implicates two critical issues.  First, the decision of the lower court jeopardizes long-standing principles of employment discrimination law.  Distinct judicial approaches to the analyses of subtle and overt discrimination have been crucial to the effectiveness of Title VII in reducing the many forms of discrimination which continue to plague the American workplace.  To blur these distinctions is to weaken the ability of Title VII to protect against even the most blatant forms of employment discrimination, such as the categorical exclusion of a class from employment opportunities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Second, this case raises issues of employer responsibility for the maintenance of healthy work environments.  As a consequence of disadvantage and discrimination, African American workers are overrepresented in dirty industries and jobs.  Employment policies which focus on the danger of workplace hazards to only a particular class of people \b \i0 \ul0 [*48]\b0 \i0 \ul0   ignore the larger dimension of the problem and threaten the health status of those workers who remain on the job.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the Seventh Circuit should be reversed.
