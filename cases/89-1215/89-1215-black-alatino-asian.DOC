\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \'a7 2000e, et seq., as amended ("Title VII") was intended to eradicate employment discrimination based \b \i0 \ul0 [*9]\b0 \i0 \ul0   on sex, including pregnancy.  42 U.S.C. \'a7 2000e(k).  Congress' actions were based, in large part, on a recognition that unemployment and occupational segregation have serious consequences for women and families, especially children.  As a result, Congress intended to strike at the "full range" of such practices.  (Point I)
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The facts upon which Congress relied remain true today.  Specifically, Congress recognized that women's employment is critical to the welfare of families (Point IA) that serious health consequences are associated with denial of employment opportunities (Point IB), and that stereotypes about women limit those opportunities.  (Point IC) Congress concluded that it was essential to make the right to work compatible with the right to have a family.  (Point ID)
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Congress thus expressed the commitment to full employment rights in unequivocal language.  (Point IIA).  The limited exception to the statutory mandate does not apply here.  In particular, costs of employing women or improving working conditions do not justify a policy that excludes women from employment opportunities.  (Point IIB) The lower courts that have attempted to craft new approaches \b \i0 \ul0 [*10]\b0 \i0 \ul0   to the statute's requirement have impermissibly distorted the statutory scheme.  (Point IIC) Enforcement of Title VII will return occupational health and safety determinations to federal regulatory authorities, whose efforts to improve workplace conditions have been undermined by the opinion of the court below.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 ARGUMENT
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Introduction
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This case presents the question of whether Title VII prohibits an employment practice that restricts opportunities for women who are willing and able to work because of the chance that they may become pregnant and that a workplace hazard may harm the fetus.  Judge Easterbrook, dissenting in the court below, considered it "likely the most important sex discrimination case in any court since . . . Congress enacted Title VII" and predicted that the decision, unless reversed, could limit women's access to as many as "20 million industrial jobs." International Union, UAW v. Johnson Controls, Appendix to the Petition For Certiorari (hereinafter "Pet. App.") at 99a and 100a.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This is no exaggeration.  In a variety of forms, these policies are already pervasive; they are most pronounced in industries historically closed to women, where high wages and \b \i0 \ul0 [*11]\b0 \i0 \ul0   good benefits make jobs particularly attractive to unskilled workers with few other options. n3 For many women and men, such employment offers the only alternative to poverty. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n3 See, Paul, et al., Corporate Response to Reproductive Hazards in the Workplace: Results of the Family, Work and Health Survey, 16 Am. J. Occ. Med. 267 (1989) reporting a higher incidence of discriminatory policies in male intensive industries.  See generally, Committee on Education and Labor, A Report on the EEOC, Title VII and Workplace Fetal Protection Policies in the 1980s, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. (Comm. Print 1990) (hereinafter "House Committee Report").
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The court of appeals' characterization that women take these jobs "to better the family's station in life," Pet. App. at 51a, understates the significance of this kind of employment to the well-being of women and their families.  The stories of women and men affected by these discriminatory policies offer an insight into the reality of life outside the courtroom walls and graphically illustrate the profound personal and economic effects of policies requiring women to choose between their jobs and their fertility.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Most of these women are deeply \b \i0 \ul0 [*12]\b0 \i0 \ul0   concerned about the health and well-being of their families.  These are not women who "might somehow rationally discount" the risks of work and selfishly sacrifice the health of their children for mere "financial reward." Pet. App. at 51a and 21a.  They work because they must, at the best jobs they can get.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 [When] I began working in the foundry of an automobile plant . . . I had one small child and when my husband and I separated, I needed to find a job with good salary and benefits.  The plant was the only place in the area that offered both . . .  If I lost my job I would never find anything comparable to what I now have.  A woman who is in her late thirties as I am would probably only be able to get a job as a sales clerk in the shopping mall or as a waitress in a fast food restaurant.  (A-71-72) n4

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In 1978 or 1979 [my brother] was tested and had a very high blood lead level.  In 1980 or 1981 he collapsed on the job melting ore (iron) in the melting area . . .  [He] was forty four years old when he had the heart attack, and . . . I strongly believe [it] may very well have been caused by the many years he spent working in the high lead melting area and nearby areas.  A-46

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Both men and women have little information and fewer choices.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 You might say that we're sort of caught between a rock and a hard \b \i0 \ul0 [*14]\b0 \i0 \ul0   place.  Some men prefer to ignore the health issue and just gamble that they or their children won't get sick.  A-65

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 I decided to have the sterilization because I needed to keep my job . . .  I knew that my husband and I were going to separate, and that I would have to support myself and my son.  In addition, I had always helped my parents who were elderly and infirm . . .  I was 26 years old when I was sterilized.  A-52-53
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Johnson Controls has elected to disregard the risks of lead to male workers and to "protect" women by denying them jobs instead of improving workplace conditions. n5 In validating this approach, the decision below is inconsistent with the conclusions of federal health authorities that men and women require an equivalent degree of workplace protection to safeguard their own health and that of future generations.  It also conflicts with regulations adopted pursuant to the Occupational Safety and Health Act, 29 U.S.C. \'a7 651, et seq. ("OSH Act") that require employers to protect both men and women planning families at the level of exposure at which Johnson Controls excludes women. n6 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n5 Johnson Controls' assertion that hazardous conditions cannot be improved is palpably untrue, as federal regulators and public health experts have found.  See Brief amici curiae of the American Public Health Ass'n, et al.  ("APHA Brief").  If Johnson Controls could not comply with occupational health standards, it would be required to apply to the Secretary of Labor for a variance.  29 U.S.C. \'a7 655(6)(A).  See also General Electric Co. v. Secretary of Labor, 576 F.2d 558 (3d Cir. 1978).
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n6 Final Standard for Occupational Exposure to Lead, 29 C.F.R. \'a7 1910.1025 (1989).  OSHA's Lead Standard and subsequent regulatory actions regarding lead are discussed extensively in the APHA Brief.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The lower court assumed that women will make inappropriate decisions about work and childbearing; it would defer to "an employer [who] adopts an employment policy designed to address a difficult societal problem," Pet. App. at 49a, even though that policy offers neither workplace safety for men nor equity for women.  The court thus ignored not only the Congressional mandate expressed in OSHA, but also the conclusions Congress reached in enacting and amending Title VII, that unemployment and underemployment pose serious risks for women and their families, and that women cannot be forced to forego childbearing in order to work.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 I.  The Objectives Congress Sought To Achieve When It Adopted And Amended Title VII Are Directly Threatened By Policies Such As Johnson Controls'
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Title VII prohibits intentional sex discrimination in employment unless sex is a bona fide occupational qualification ("BFOQ").  42 U.S.C. \'a7 2000e-2(e)(1).  Phillips v. Martin Marietta Corp., 400 U.S. 542 (1971). Cf. Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, U.S.  , 109 S.Ct. 1775 (1989) (mixed motive case).  In response to Gilbert v. General Electric, 429 U.S. 677 (1976), \b \i0 \ul0 [*16]\b0 \i0 \ul0   holding that pregnancy-based discrimination was not per se gender-based discrimination within the meaning of Title VII, Congress enacted the Pregnancy Discrimination Act ("PDA") "to make plain that, under Title VII . . . discrimination based on pregnancy, childbirth and related medical conditions is discrimination based on sex.  Thus, the bill defines sex discrimination, as proscribed in the existing statute, to include these physiological occurrences peculiar to women[.]" n7 The PDA further "illustrate[s] how discrimination against pregnancy is to be remedied." n8 Women, whether or not pregnant, are entitled to employment opportunities based solely on the "ability or inability to work." 42 U.S.C. \'a7 2000e(k).

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Because women are as capable of producing batteries as men are, the plain language of Title VII, as amended by the PDA,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*17]\b0 \i0 \ul0   clearly prohibits Johnson Controls' policy, regardless of whether that policy is construed as discriminating against all women or potentially pregnant women. n9 As the extensive legislative record underlying the PDA reveals, Title VII was intended to redress "the full range of discriminatory practices which have adversely affected [women's] status in the work force." n10 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n9 The court below concluded that the policy did not apply to all women, but affected only those capable of bearing children.  E.g., Pet. App. at 43a.  The terms of the policy, however, draw explicit gender based lines.  All women (but no men), for example are required to submit medical evidence of sterility as a condition of employment.
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n10 Legis. Hist., supra note 7 at 63.  (emphasis supplied).
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In particular, Congress recognized that women's employment is critical to the welfare of women and families, that denial of access to employment opportunities results in a lower standard of living with devastating consequences, and that sex-based stereotypes limit women's employment opportunities.  In consideration of both the equity of women's claim to equal employment opportunity and the practical necessity of \b \i0 \ul0 [*18]\b0 \i0 \ul0   work for many women, Congress expressly endorsed the proposition that no woman should have to sacrifice the right to work in order to have a family, nor sacrifice the right to have a family in order to work.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 As demonstrated below, policies like Johnson Controls' directly threaten the principal goals to be achieved by Title VII's prohibitions on sex discrimination.  A construction of the statute permitting such policies would frustrate its very purposes.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Policies that deny women employment reflect an assumption that women can forego employment without serious consequences, but the facts are otherwise.  In both single parent and dual wage earner households, women's employment is critical to the maintenance of many families, and the loss or reduction of a woman's income will have devastating effects, as Congress acknowledged:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In many low-income families the financial support provided by the mother has become essential for the families' economic survival. . . .  In an increasing number of middle-income families the support and the well being of the family has become inextricably tied to the income generated by females.  \b \i0 \ul0 [*19]\b0 \i0 \ul0   n11

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In dual wage earner families, fulltime working wives contribute an average of 37.6% of the family income, and the poorer the family, the more critical the wife's contribution.  In families in which the total income is less than $ 15,000, that contribution averages more than half. n12 In 1984, for example, poverty was 35% lower than it would have been had wives not worked. n13

Statistics on the extent of wage disparity due to occupational segregation reflect the pervasiveness of such practices and Congress found them "shocking". n18 The data reveal that the problem is particularly acute for unskilled women who are concentrated in low-paying, female intensive industries n19 and minimum wage jobs. n20

Title VII and other civil rights measures brought these women the promise of such employment, n21 but policies like Johnson Controls' would close the workplace doors once again.  Indeed, sex-based policies take their most extreme and oppressive form in occupations characterized by high wages, good benefits, and entrenched gender-based segregation. n22 Johnson Controls' policy, effectively excluding women from all employment in its battery plants, is typical of restrictions in male dominated industries. n23 Thus, women are now subject to exclusion from the very jobs and occupations that Congress specifically identified as critical to their economic well being and that of their families.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Johnson Controls' policy assumes that all women who are capable of becoming pregnant will do so, indeed that they might be pregnant at any moment.  The policy applies to all women, regardless of their circumstances, their desire to become pregnant, or the likelihood of pregnancy. n48 Even though most women do become pregnant at some time in their lives, it is the grossest form of stereotyping to assume that every woman who is capable of conceiving is always about to do so.  Once again, the policy at issue in this case threatens a principal \b \i0 \ul0 [*32]\b0 \i0 \ul0   purpose of Title VII: to eliminate decision-making based on group characteristics, especially when the result is to deny job opportunities to individuals capable of working.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Congress was aware that the PDA would preclude employers from adopting policies that restricted women's employment to protect the fetus, but declined to carve out a special exception based on such concerns. n55 Moreover, the Senate was particularly troubled by the possibility that restrictive employment policies based on pregnancy might force women to have unwanted abortions in order to keep their jobs. n56 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n55 The Chamber of Commerce opposed the legislation, in part because the PDA would prohibit employment decisions based on concerns for the health of a pregnant woman or her child.  The issue was raised in the hearings in a question to Andre Hellegers, M.D. who testified that men and fetuses all require equivalent protection.  See APHA Brief, pp. 10-12.
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n56 See, e.g., Legis. Hist., supra note 7 at 116 ("One of our basic purposes in introducing this bill is to prevent the tragedy of an unwanted abortion forced on a woman because she cannot afford to leave her job without pay to carry out the full term of her pregnancy").  Congress also addressed the possibility that employers might attempt to impose their own ethical values on employees and retaliate against women who had abortions.  See e.g., id. at 117.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 As a result of these concerns, Congress repeatedly emphasized that Title VII was intended to enable women to combine work and family life and to permit them to make personal decisions without employment related consequences.  The language varies, but the message is clear and consistent.  Congress sought to offer women "protection and security without fear of reprisal due to their decision to bear children" n57 and to "put an end to an unrealistic and unfair system that forces women to chose between family and career[.]" n58 Indeed, the "entire thrust" of the PDA was "to guarantee women the basic right to participate fully and equally in the workforce without denying them the fundamental right to full participation in family life." n59

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In sum, Congress clearly considered the economic, social and personal costs incurred when women are denied good jobs and employment security.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 A.  The Statutory Mandate is Unambiguous and Must Be Enforced.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Congress' decision to provide women full and equal employment rights, including the right to make their own choices about working, was expressed in the clearest of statutory mandates.  Title VII prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of sex, including "pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions".  Further, it requires that women, including those affected by pregnancy childbirth or related medical conditions be treated the same "for all employment related purposes. . . as others not so affected but \b \i0 \ul0 [*38]\b0 \i0 \ul0   similar in their ability or inability to work." 42 U.S.C. \'a7 2000e(k). n60 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n60 The Act's sole affirmative defense, BFOQ, permits exceptions based only on occupational qualifications, i.e., qualifications associated with job performance, and this is consistent with the clear intent and plain language of the PDA.  This Court has not addressed the meaning of the BFOQ defense in a sex discrimination case brought after the adoption of the PDA, but prior interpretations are consistent with the understanding that the defense must be closely linked to performance of important job functions.  See Dothard v. Rawlinson, 433 U.S. 321 (1977) and Western Air Lines v. Criswell, 472 U.S. 400 (1982).
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The PDA restated Congress' original intent to prohibit all forms of sex discrimination. n61 This Court recognized this Congressional purpose recently, in California Federal Savings and Loan Association v. Guerra, 479 U.S. 272 (1987). Despite divergent views on the applicability of the Act in other contexts, eight members of the Court agreed that the PDA prohibits intentional discrimination against women who are or might be pregnant,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*39]\b0 \i0 \ul0   but who are able to work. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n61 Prior to enactment of Title VII, rules barring marriage and motherhood for female employees were commonplace.  E.g., Phillips v. Martin Marietta Corp., 400 U.S. 542 (1971) (per curiam). Pregnant women were placed on mandatory maternity leave, Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur, 414 U.S. 632 (1974), and were denied accrued seniority and other benefits.  Cf.  Nashville Gas Co. v. Satty, 434 U.S. 136 (1977). Pregnancy was widely excluded from employment-related health insurance and disability plans.  Gilbert v. General Electric Co., 429 U.S. 125 (1976), Geduldig v. Aiello, 417 U.S. 484 (1974). The legislative history of the PDA reveals Congressional intent to solve the problem of sex and pregnancy discrimination definitively.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The majority opinion acknowledged the controlling significance of the "ability or inability to work" language of the statute: the "second clause was intended to . . . illustrate how discrimination against pregnancy is to be remedied." Cal Fed, 479 U.S. at 285. This reading was necessary to effectuate the Congressional purpose "to provide relief \b \i0 \ul0 [*40]\b0 \i0 \ul0   for working women," id. at 286, and to "'protect [them] from the full range of discriminatory practices.'" Id. at 299 n.3 (White, J., dissenting).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Justice White, writing for himself, Justice Powell and Chief Justice Rehnquist, disagreed with the majority's conclusion that the statute permits state mandated preferential treatment of pregnant workers, n62 but had no disagreement regarding its absolute prohibition on the type of discriminatory practice involved here.  Quoting from the Senate Report that "'treatment of pregnant women. . .must focus. . .on the actual effects of their condition on their ability to work'," Justice White noted that the "'ability to work'" language means "'exactly what it says in a situation where it is directly implicated.'" Id. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n62 Unlike Cal Fed, there is no suggestion here that the policy at issue might help "'to achieve equality of employment opportunities and remove barriers.'" Id. at 288, quoting Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 429-30 (1971).
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The opinions of the members of the Court sitting in the Cal Fed case evidence virtually unanimous recognition of the PDA's purpose to eradicate \b \i0 \ul0 [*41]\b0 \i0 \ul0   all forms of discrimination against women based on sex or childbearing capacity. n63 As the Court acknowledged, the commitment to provide women full employment rights was conditioned only on the "ability to work" standard. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n63 Justices Stevens and Scalia, concurring, addressed other issues not relevant here, but indicated no disagreement with these principles as articulated in the majority opinion.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This result is not surprising.  Numerous decisions of this Court have reiterated that "the starting point for interpreting a statute is the language of the statute itself.  Absent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary, the language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive." Consumers Product Safety Commission v. GTE Sylvania, 447 U.S. 102, 108 (1980). The duty of the federal courts to enforce the plain language of federal statutes precludes independent judicial assessment of the wisdom of Congress' decision:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Our individual appraisal of the wisdom or unwisdom of a particular course selected by Congress is to be put aside in the process of interpreting a statute.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360  TVA v. Hill, 437 U.S . 153, 194-95 (1978).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Even if this Court, like \b \i0 \ul0 [*42]\b0 \i0 \ul0   the majority of the Seventh Circuit, were to disagree with Congress' conclusion that employers may not substitute their evaluation of the risks and benefits of work (including the risks and benefits to current and future children) for the decisions of women themselves, it is bound by the Congressional decision to the contrary, precisely because certain judgments are committed to the legislative process:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 [The Court has] no expert knowledge on the subject, much less do we have a mandate from the people to strike a balance of equities. . . Congress has spoken in the plainest of words, making it abundantly clear that the balance has been struck.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360  Id. at 194.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 B.  The Possibility That Employer Costs Will Increase As A Result of Women's Employment Does Not Affect the Statutory Mandate Against Discrimination.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Departures from the statutory mandate are not permitted even if additional costs may result from compliance:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Even a very high cost could not justify continuation of the policy of discrimination against pregnant women which has played such a major part in the pattern of sex discrimination in this country. n64 
\par \pard

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 As a result,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*43]\b0 \i0 \ul0   the Court has invalidated the use of accurate, sex-based actuarial tables in setting pension and life insurance rates, notwithstanding the fact that use of non-discriminatory tables would arguably increase employer costs.  Los Angeles Dep't of Water and Power v. Manhart, 435 U.S. 702. See also Arizona Governing Committee v. Norris, 463 U.S. 1073, 1084-65 n. 14 (1983) ("the greater costs of providing retirement benefits for female employees does not justify the use of a sex-based plan.") Thus, even if women did require additional protections from occupational exposures, Title VII would require that employers bear the costs of making the workplace safe. n65 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n65 Congress has sought to minimize the risks of employment for both working women and men through the Occupational Safety and Health Act, 29 U.S.C. \'a7 651, et seq., which requires that health protection be afforded at the "most protective" level, subject to constraints imposed by technological and economic feasibility.  American Textile Manufacturers Institute v. Donovan, 452 U.S. 490 (1981). It is entirely appropriate that the cost issue be addressed by a regulatory agency and on an industry-wide basis.  See APHA Brief.  A Title VII defense based on firm-specific "clean-up costs" would reward the least efficient employers by allowing them to discriminate while putting more viable concerns at a competitive disadvantage.  Such a defense could also result in irrational and inconsistent application of the statute, even within a single jurisdiction.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  \b \i0 \ul0 [*44]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Johnson Controls did not assert a cost-based defense to this Title VII action, presumably in recognition of the Court's unambiguous holdings on the issue.  Nevertheless, the issue is addressed in the opinions in the court below.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The costs of providing equal employment opportunities in the face of recognized reproductive hazards might include not only the cost of making the workplace safe, but also the cost of potential tort liability to children of workers exposed to lead. n66 Judge Posner, in dissent, was particularly concerned with the second issue and suggested that such liability might at some point "become large enough to affect the company's normal mode of operation and supply the ground for a bona fide occupational qualification." Pet. App at 68a.  As noted above, this approach lacks statutory or precedential authority and indeed simply ignores the PDA's command that women who are able to work must be permitted to do so. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n66 In addition, both Judge Posner and the majority expressed some concern about the costs to society for caring for children who might be harmed by women's occupational exposure.  Indeed, despite the lack of any documentation, the majority relied on these potential costs to support its conclusion that the policy was jusitifed.  Pet. App. at 51a.  This approach is legally insupportable and totally inconsistent with Congress' conclusion that the social cost of denying women equal employment outweighed countervailing concerns.  The majority balanced the interests of "the employer, the employee, and the unborn child," Pet. App. at 42a, as if this were not a legislative function, and more importantly, as if the balance had not already been struck by Congress on the basis of careful consideration and extensive evidence.  See Point I, supra.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  \b \i0 \ul0 [*45]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 There are, however, additional reasons to reject the suggestion that the potential for tort liability should constitute a defense in Title VII cases:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In today's litigious society, the potential for litigation rests in almost every human activity. . . .  The employer is, of course, free to protect itself from financially ruinous lawsuits by purchasing insurance and maintaining the degree of care required by law.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360  Hayes v. Shelby Mem. Hosp., 726 F.2d at 1553 n.15. For a responsible employer, the risk of liability to children of female workers is remote, as discussed below.  In any event, there is also a risk of liability to children of male workers, as well as to consumers and others. n67 Johnson Controls and other employers with similar policies undertake these risks as a part of doing business.  They have presented no reason to suggest that any liability-related concerns associated with women's employment cannot be handled in precisely the same manner. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n67 Becker, supra note 21 at 1236-37, 1245.  (noting instances in which the children of male workers assert paternally-mediated genetic injury).
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Johnson Controls can cite no suits brought by children of women workers exposed to lead.  On the other hand, there has been a tort suit brought by male workers, their wives and children alleging intentional injury or gross negligence.  Wade v. Johnson Controls, 693 F.2d 19 (2d Cir. 1982). There has also been at least one significant judgment against the company on the basis of defective products.  Jones, et al. v. Sears and Roebuck, Inc., Globe Union, Inc., et. al., No. 585-427 (Cal. Super. Ct., San Diego County, May 17, 1987), appeal filed No. D009904 (Cal. Ct. App., 4th App. Dist., Div. 1, filed Apr. 10, 1990) ($ 9.7 million jury verdict for plaintiffs injured by exploding battery).

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Finally, permitting a defense based on potential liability would undermine the deterrence and safety-enhancing goals of tort law.  An employer who complies with OSHA standards, implements available technology to reduce exposures and adequately warns employees of remaining but unavoidable risks is not likely to be held liable to subsequently born children on either a negligence or strict liability theory.  n68 A cost-based defense would therefore eliminate any incentive created by the tort system to make the workplace safe, while giving employers wholesale license to exclude any class of workers they deem, for whatever reason, particularly vulnerable. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n68 See generally, 1 S. Pegalis and H. Wachsman, American Law of Medical Malpractice at 98-103 (1980) and 2 M. Dixon and F. Woodside, Drug Product Liaiblity \'a7 11.02[1] (1989); Hughson v. St. Francis Hospital, 459 N.Y.S.2d 814 (N.Y. App. 1984) (pregnant woman's consent to medical procedures is binding on subsequently born child); Needham v. White Laboratories, 847 F.2d 355 (7th Cir. 1988), (adequate warning provided to pregnant women sufficient to preclude "failure to warn" claim by later born child).  In the medical malpractice context, the informed consent decisions are premised on respect for personal autonomy and the notion that competent adults should be permitted to make reasoned risk assessments for themselves and minor children (and fetuses).  This approach is, of course, consistent with that taken by Congress in Title VII, see, Point I, supra, and effectively disposes of Judge Posner's concern about the problem of irreducible risks.  See Pet. App. at 66a and 69a.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 C.  The Court Below And Other Courts Of Appeals Have Failed To Implement Title VII As Congress Intended.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In its decision to permit a "business necessity" defense, the court below purported to follow two decisions rendered by other circuits. n69 Both of those cases, however, represent significant departures from the statutory scheme, as it has been consistently interpreted by this Court. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n69 Wright v. Olin Corp. 697 F.2d 1172 and Hayes v. Shelby Mem. Hosp., 726 F.2d 1543.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In Wright v. Olin Corp., the court acknowledged that a sex-based policy of exclusion could not satisfy the BFOQ standard, 697 F.2d at 1185-86, n.21, and then rejected that analysis specifically to permit a defense, predictably distorting Title VII in the process.  While it is true, as that court notes, that a Title VII plaintiff may advance different theories, it is not correspondingly true that a defendant may proffer any defense regardless of the nature of the prima facie case.  Rather, the defense, to be availing, must specifically match the gravamen of the claim.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Claims and defenses in Title VII cases can be generally grouped in three separate tiers.  At one \b \i0 \ul0 [*48]\b0 \i0 \ul0   level is the individual disparate treatment case, in which intentional discrimination is inferred from differential treatment.  Articulation of a non-discriminatory reason provides a defense to the prima facie case, which can then be rebutted by proof that the proferred explanation is a pretext for discrimination. n70 Intent is irrelevant in disparate impact cases, which focus on the effects of discrimination, as shown by a statistically significant effect of a neutral policy on a protected group.  The employer must show that "the challenged practice serves, in a significant way, the legitimate employment goals of the employer." n71 Finally, overt facial discrimination can only be justified by the most rigorous standard, BFOQ, and is otherwise flatly prohibited.  See p.45 n. 60, supra. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n70 E.g., Texas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248 (1981). The inapplicability of this analysis to cases involving overt discrimination is conceded in Wright and Hayes. Cf. Trans World Airlines v. Thurston, 469 U.S. 111 (1985).
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n71 Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Antonio, 490 U.S.  , 109 S.Ct. 2115 (1989) ("business necessity" defense).
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 A sex \b \i0 \ul0 [*49]\b0 \i0 \ul0   or pregnancy-based policy cannot be deemed "neutral." Title VII has been amended specifically to preclude that construction.  See Point IIA, supra. Nevertheless, the Wright court applied the lower level business necessity defense, which was crafted for cases not involving intentional or overt discrimination.  Congress clearly stated that where overt or intentional discrimination is involved, the challenged practice can be justified only as a BFOQ.  The approach adopted by the Fourth Circuit is thus unauthorized, illogical and, as a matter of law, must be rejected. n72 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n72 See also Becker, supra note 21 at 1251, 1260-63.  This distinction between overt discrimination and discrimination resulting from neutral practices is not mere "semantic quibbling," Wright, 697 F.2d at 1186, but has substantial significance.  Under Title VII, the employer has always borne the burden of proof to justify a demonstrably discriminatory policy.  E.g., Dothard v. Rawlinson, 433 U.S. 321. That rule has been altered in cases involving disparate impact, but not in those involving intentional discrimination.  Compare Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U.S.  , 109 S.Ct 2115 with Price-Waterhouse v. Hopkins, U.S.  , 109 S.Ct. 1755 (mixed motive).
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  \b \i0 \ul0 [*50]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Hayes court embraced a different, but related, error in its desire to permit a defense.  Ignoring the male and female employee/parents who are the intended beneficiaries of Title VII, that court decided that a policy that protected their offspring "neutrally," i.e. provided the same level of protection, was a "neutral policy," justifiable by business necessity.  But, once again, Title VII unequivocally rejects any contention that an overt pregnancy or sex-based policy can be "neutral," n73 regardless of its effect on offspring.  By definition, it is not neutral with respect to workers, who may nor may not become parents, and it is their rights Title VII protects. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n73 It was precisely this fiction the PDA was intended to eliminate.  See Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co. v. EEOC, 462 U.S. 669. (1983).
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Supreme Court has unequivocally rejected the notion that sex-based classifications can somehow be justified because of arguably "neutral" effects:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 . . .the Department argues that the absence of a discriminatory effect on women as a class justifies an employment practice which, on its face, discriminated against individual employees because of their \b \i0 \ul0 [*51]\b0 \i0 \ul0   sex.  But even if the Department's actuarial evidence is sufficient to prevent plaintiffs from establishing a prima facie case on the theory that the effect of the practice on women as a class was discriminatory, that evidence does not defeat the claim that the practice, on its face, discriminated against every individual woman employed by the Department.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360  Manhart, 435 U.S. at 716. This Court has also held that it is no defense to intermediate acts of discrimination that the final result of an employment process, or "bottom line," is non-discriminatory.  Connecticut v. Teal, 457 U.S. 440 (1982). Thus, even if the "bottom line" - the effect on offspring - were the same for women and men, it remains true that women are subjected to discriminatory treatment because Johnson Controls' policy and others like it impose on them terms and conditions of employment which are not applied to men.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In sum, the disparate treatment "business necessity" analysis applied in Wright, Hayes and the court below is inappropriate here.  Johnson Controls' policy can be justified only as a BFOQ.  However, because women can perform the jobs at issue, this defense is unavailing as \b \i0 \ul0 [*52]\b0 \i0 \ul0   a matter of law.  A contrary result would conflict with the plain language of Title VII and the central goals underlying the legislation.

The AFSC carries out its work as a service agency of the Society of Friends in America.  The AFSC has a vital interest in this litigation because of our belief in the infinite worth of each human being and the equality of all human beings in the sight of God.  This belief has led the AFSC to commit a significant portion of its resources to work which seeks to root out the causes of violence in society which lie in poverty and imbalance of wealth, in exclusion, and denial of rights.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 AFSC works in this country and in other parts of the world in support of the efforts of women to have access to jobs that provide adequate income in workplaces that are free of hazards.  We have worked for the past decade, in parts of Appalachia in support of women challenging exclusion from jobs in coal mining and road \b \i0 \ul0 [*55]\b0 \i0 \ul0   construction, the only well-paid jobs available to people without college degrees.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In addition AFSC has worked along the Mexico - U.S. border for more than twenty years in programs dealing with health, human rights and economic development.  In the 1970s we became concerned about the impact of maquiladoras, the foreign-owned assembly plants located in Mexico along the border between the two countries.  We have seen vividly the impact on the health and safety of the young women who work at extremely low wages - $ 4 a day or less - in plants which give little attention to health and safety considerations.  One of these plants is owned by Johnson Controls in Reynosa, Mexico, making automation controls, including day long work with lead solder.  Our staff report that the company does not provide warnings in Spanish of the danger of lead exposure to fetuses, does not test workers' blood and actively recruits young women workers.

Many of these immigrant women suffer from extremely poor working conditions and occupational hazards.  For instance, the electronics industry has a high rate of occupation related illnesses compared to other businesses.  Environmental pollution is also a problem in neighborhoods near electronic plants, where toxics have been discovered in the water and residents have reported a higher incidence of birth defects and miscarriages.  Seamstresses develop respiratory diseases, eye strain, and muscle pains from inhaling dust, threads and fabric dyes.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 I worked for five years in a high lead department of a chemical factory.  Though the work was hard, the pay (about $ 13.00/hour) and benefits were very good.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 I was told, both at my job interview and during the orientation on my first day of work, that the research on the dangers of working around lead were still out and that there were no conclusions, either pro or con that could be drawn from the research.  I was therefore surprised to learn after \b \i0 \ul0 [*76]\b0 \i0 \ul0   I had worked there for a while that management had introduced a policy which prohibited all women who could conceive from working in the high lead areas.  At the time I learned about the policy I was also told that if I wanted to continue working around lead I would have to give personnel a letter from my doctor confirming that I could not have children.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 At this time I was married and had no plans to have any children.  I thought that I would be exempt from the policy because my husband had had a vasectomy.  However the plant manager told me that even though my husband had been sterilized I could still "screw around."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 I was informed by a personnel representative that I could definitely keep my job in the high lead area if I would agree to being sterilized.  However I would have to have an examination by the company doctor to determine if I could have children and sign a paper stating that I would not sue the company.  I refused to sign the paper, and within a few days, I was laid off.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 I eventually took a job at a fast-food restaurant at a substantial cut in pay.  It took me a long time to find work after my layoff because the economic situation in my community and the surrounding \b \i0 \ul0 [*77]\b0 \i0 \ul0   area is very bad.  There are no other companies within 20-25 miles of where I live that offer comparable salaries or benefits to those of the chemical plant.

In addition to his full time job at the chemical plant, my husband had to take a part-time job in construction and work seven days a week.  Even with my husband working so much, we were barely making ends meet.  The loss of income from my salary also created a lot of tension between us.  During that time we seemed to argue often over money and how we were going to pay our bills.

I wasn't given any reason, and even my doctor said that I could continue working.  The personnel director informed me that if I had wanted to keep my job then I shouldn't have gotten pregnant.  I filed a grievance through the union for discrimination, but in a meeting I and the shop steward had with the personnel director, I was told that the only way I could get my job back would be to lose the baby.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 I was very upset.  Nobody was able to help.  The union was unable to do anything and my doctor refused to sign the papers for disability because he said that I could still work.  A few days after my meeting with the personnel director, I miscarried the pregnancy.  I had been approximately thirteen to fourteen weeks pregnant.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In 1976 I began working in the foundry of an automobile plant.  At that time I had one child.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The first time I learned about the policy excluding women of childbearing capacity was late in 1980, after I had already had my second child, when I was told to go to the company's medical department.  They told me that I could \b \i0 \ul0 [*79]\b0 \i0 \ul0   not continue to work in the foundry as an iron pourer because this job exposed me to a high level of lead.  I was also told that in order to keep my job I would have to be sterilized.  There were no exceptions to the policy, even though I told the medical people that I was then using birth control and had no plans for becoming pregnant.  I objected to the policy and, along with other women in the plant, filed a grievance with the union against the company for discrimination.  The union negotiated a slightly modified policy with the company and I remained on my job.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Between 1979 and 1983 I was laid off due to a general work slow down.  When I was called back to work I was transferred to iron pouring.  However after a few weeks I was removed again because of the policy and as a result I filed charges of discrimination and harassment with a state agency.  Because of my complaint I was harassed and threatened with discharge.  However because of my seniority I transferred to another department and have only worked in iron pouring as a temporary replacement for another worker for three months in 1985.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 After the policy was modified all the women were closely monitored for blood lead levels \b \i0 \ul0 [*80]\b0 \i0 \ul0   and if their lead level was too high they were either moved to another department where the air lead level was lower or they had to wear respirators.  Transfer to another department meant losing about $ .45 or $ .50/hour in salary.  There was also less overtime and weekend work in the low lead departments.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In 1984, two women were removed because they had high blood lead levels and told they could not return even when their lead level dropped to normal because the air lead level was too high.  However again, I was allowed to work their overtime, probably because I had filed the charges.  By the end of 1984 I was under a lot of stress.  I was always under pressure on my job because of harrassment from my foreman.  The company had modified its policy somewhat, and other women were allowed to return to high lead areas, but I was not, except as a relief worker.  Even after several years, I don't feel that my job in the melting department is secure, because could move me at any time.  I also think the policy is psychologically degrading because keeping my job doesn't really depend on whether I'm good at my work or have seniority, but hangs only on whether I can have children.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 I liked \b \i0 \ul0 [*81]\b0 \i0 \ul0   my job as an iron pourer very much and don't want to work at anything else.  However I have not been able to return to this job on a steady basis.  The company has no openings in the skilled trades and they are not adding new jobs.  There are also no other companies in this area of the state that pay as high a salary and offer such good benefits as the automobile plant.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 STATEMENT OF INTEREST OF ALVA LEWIS
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 I have been employed in an automobile plant for twenty-five years, and work in the skilled trades as a millwright.  I believe that the plant has always had a policy of testing the blood/lead levels of people who worked in the high lead areas.  However, I don't believe this policy was routinely enforced.  For example, my brother worked in the foundry and the melting area melting ore for about twenty-six years, but as far as I know he had only one blood test.  In 1978 or 1979, he was tested and had a very high blood/lead level.  In 1980 or 1981 he collapsed on the job melting ore (iron) in the melting area.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 My brother was forty-four years old when he had the heart attack, and due to the events surrounding his heart attack, I strongly believe his heart attack may very well have \b \i0 \ul0 [*82]\b0 \i0 \ul0   been caused by the many years he spent working in the high lead melting area and nearby areas.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 When the company enforced its policy with respect to women working in the high lead areas, I was a union Committeeman At Large and at first I thought it was a good idea.  However I, and the other representatives, also recognized that the jobs in these areas paid higher wages and often offered more overtime than jobs in other departments in the plant.  After debate and consultation the union decided to support the women because we thought that the policy discriminated against women who wanted and probably needed to work in the high paying jobs to support their families.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The foundry is a very hot and dirty area of the plant and after having fabricated, installed and repaired industrial ventilation systems at this plant for the past twenty-five years, and after having had training in industrial ventilation engineering I am aware that many measures can be taken to improve this workplace.  However we have two major problems with achieving this goal.  One is after management has spent thousands and even millions to install a system, they assume the systems will last forever and ignore the need \b \i0 \ul0 [*83]\b0 \i0 \ul0   to maintain them.  They also allow amateurs who have great authority and no expertise to modify the systems to suit a particular temporary need which soon results in decreasing the efficiency of the system and in some cases nearly destroying it.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 I began work at the electronics company in 1979.  At that time I was married, but we did not have any children.  I was a specialist in etching and enjoyed the work very much.  It required dexterity and I found it challenging.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 When I was hired I wasn't told about any personnel policy regarding pregnant workers, or about hazards in the workplace.  But when I became pregnant with my first child, my supervisor told me that I had to have my doctor sign a form authorizing my working with certain chemicals.  Before signing the form my doctor asked me whether I wanted to keep my job.  He was the one who told me that if the form was not signed, I would not have a job.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 I worked throughout my first pregnancy.  But after my maternity leave, I was told that there was no job available for me and that I would be called in when something opened up.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 I was finally called back to work and in a few weeks went \b \i0 \ul0 [*84]\b0 \i0 \ul0   on graveyard shift.  Later I became pregnant a second time and informed my supervisor.  This time my doctor refused to authorize my working with chemicals.  I was told by personnel that it would be difficult for them to find me another job in the company because my salary was so high and because my skills were in jobs that involved exposure to chemicals.  After a couple of weeks, I was finally offered an interview for a job in another area, but it would have meant taking a 45 percent pay cut.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Financially, my layoff created difficulties.  Our rent was raised twice during this time and there were many nights that I stayed awake worrying about paying bills.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 After my maternity leave, I called the company and told them I was ready to return to work.  After about two months, I was given a job, but with a loss in seniority and a $ .75/hour reduction in pay, and a loss of my job title.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 I had several jobs prior to working in a chemical plant, but the salary and benefits in those earlier jobs were not as good.  When I heard that the chemical plant was hiring women, I applied immediately.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 My son was eight years old when I began working in the plant.  \b \i0 \ul0 [*85]\b0 \i0 \ul0   At the time my marriage was going very badly and I did not want another child until our relationship improved.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 After the company introduced the policy barring fertile women from working in all areas but two, and then several months later just in the high lead areas, the women held several meetings with management.  I believe that management pushed sterilization because they made it clear in the meetings that the only form of birth control they considered safe was sterilization.  I had asked in one of our meetings whether my husband's vasectomy was adequate protection against my becoming pregnant and was told that it was not.  According to the company's representative, I could still fool around and get pregnant.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 I decided to have the sterilization because I needed to keep my job.  Management had said that when possible we would be transferred to a safe lead-free department in the factory, but those jobs paid less than what I was currently earning.  Besides, I didn't think there were enough jobs available in non-lead departments for all the women, and so I thought there was also the chance that I could be laid off.  I don't think I would have been able to manage financially without \b \i0 \ul0 [*86]\b0 \i0 \ul0   the higher paying job.  By the time the policy was introduced, I knew that my husband and I were going to separate, and that I would have to support myself and my parents who were elderly and infirm and if I had lost my job I would have had to reduce the amount of my support or even discontinue it altogether.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 I was 26 years old when I was sterilized and the realization of what I had done didn't hit me until two or three weeks after the operation.  Generally I'd say that I felt less a woman because of the operation.  I think that though my marriage was in bad shape, my sterilization made things even worse.  My husband was cold, distant and unfeeling about me personally.  He just cared about the money I was bringing home.  The consequences of the sterilization have even affected my second marriage.  Both my second husband and I would have very much liked to have had a child together.  In fact I tried to have the operation reversed, but was not successful.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 At the plant those of us who had been sterilized were often harassed.  In fact I think the harassment became worse after the policy was introduced and it became especially cruel after some of us were sterilized.  I overhead four \b \i0 \ul0 [*87]\b0 \i0 \ul0   men talking about my operation and they said that I "could have had the surgery done in the carpenter shop," and another supervisor told me "that anybody can screw you now." In addition men called the women "whores" and wrote signs that said for example, "save a job, shoot a woman".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 I also think the policy created some friction in the town where the factory was located.  Even twelve years after the policy and being laid-off for eight years, I still feel uncomfortable when I attend social activities where I might meet some of my former co-workers, and there are co-workers or wives of co-workers who refuse to speak to me when we meet.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 As soon as I heard that the chemical plant was hiring women, I applied for a job.  A few years after I started working, the company introduced the policy barring women from working in certain high lead jobs.  I was not in a department where women were barred from working.  But we were led to believe that sometime in the future women might be barred from working in all other departments where there were chemicals.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 During that time I was always worried about whether \b \i0 \ul0 [*88]\b0 \i0 \ul0   my job was safe.

I live alone and support myself.  After the policy was introduced, the harassment against women in the plant became much worse.  Many of the men and supervisors made us feel as though we were less than an animal.  When a woman could overhear them, they referred to the sterilizations as "going to the vets."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 I have worked since I was sixteen years old and held a variety of jobs as a waitress,nurses aide and in a factory.  These jobs paid low wages and had limited benefits.  I heard from friends that an automobile plant was hiring women, and I was hired in the late summer of 1976.  I worked in a high lead area of the foundry.  At that time, though no one mentioned that the lead levels were particularly high or that there was any danger.  Because of the policy I had to move to another job.  It made no difference that my husband had a vasectomy.  This job paid less money than the one in the foundry and I had to work overtime to make up the difference.  \b \i0 \ul0 [*89]\b0 \i0 \ul0   However, it was a hassle having to keep track of when my overtime came up and how many hours were worked.  It was made very clear to me that the only way I could go back and work in the foundry was by getting sterilized.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 I was laid off for a few months because of a general slow down in the plant, and I returned to a low lead area in the foundry.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The economic situation in this part of the state is not good.  There is only one other factory that perhaps offers comparable benefits, but the pay scale is lower.  Some smaller factories have shut down and the others are not hiring.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 I am legally separated and have three children, and receive no child support.  A few years ago, I was laid off during the slow season from my job in a paper factory, and a couple of months later when I was supposed to return to work, the company refused to hire me back because I was pregnant.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 When I was called back after the layoff, I checked with personnel to make sure about the day I was to return \b \i0 \ul0 [*90]\b0 \i0 \ul0   to work.  Later that same day, someone from the office called me and told me not to return to work because I was pregnant.  I was told that my job operating the envelope machine was dangerous to my pregnancy because I would be standing for too long.  After some time had passed, the company changed their reason and said that in operating the envelope machine I had to stretch a lot and the company believed that would be a strain on me physically.  Finally, they told me that the chemicals in the ink printed on the paper were dangerous to my baby.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The job at the paper factory which makes paper products and "novelty" items was the best I ever had.

In 1988 I went to a chemical plant to fill out applications for employment.  I was told by the personnel secretary that before I could complete an application I would first have to sign a statement that either I had been sterilized or was past menopause.  Since I was unable to sign, I could not apply for a job.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In September, I was called by the union president and told that the factory had changed its policy and that I should reapply.

One of those companies was a chemical plant, which I know offers the highest hourly wage of any employer in this area.  I was not given an application at the personnel office because I was first asked to sign a form stating that I was unable to have children.  I told them that I had children and was not planning to have any more, but was told that didn't matter.  I would still have to sign and provide proof.

During most of those years I worked in the core department where I am exposed to formaldehyde and other solvents.  I am concerned about the exposure to toxic substances because of my personal situation.  Only three of my five children are alive.  The second child was stillborn.  My third child developed cancer early in life and died at age five, and the fourth pregnancy produced twins who were prematurely born.  I am convinced that my exposure to hazardous substances in the workplace was the cause of the two deaths and possibly the premature births of the twins.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 A lot of men have a hard time relating their chemical exposures to their own health problems or those of their children.  Men just assume that during a pregnancy the health of the baby can only be affected by something the mother is exposed to.  I also think for economic reasons this issue is a hard one for many people to take a stand on.  The plant where I work isn't hiring any new workers,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*94]\b0 \i0 \ul0   and all of the men here have ten, fifteen or more years seniority.  Some people are afraid that if there is too much pressure put on the company to cleanup the workplace, then the plant will close down.  This is what happened in the New York plant where I worked.  I have twenty-five years with this company and if this plant was shut down, I know that there is no factory in this area where I could even earn a third of my current salary.  You might say that we're sort of caught between a rock and a hard place.  Some men prefer to ignore the health issue and just gamble that they or their children won't get sick.

My next job was in a textile factory, but after a while it closed.  A year later I heard that they were hiring women at a plant.  I applied for the job because it offered a much better salary ($ 4.25/hour) and better benefits than any of the jobs I had ever \b \i0 \ul0 [*95]\b0 \i0 \ul0   had before.  Even though the work was strenuous, I enjoyed it.  The money and benefits were excellent.  A few years after I started, the women were told that management had decided to prohibit all women capable of having children from working in departments where there were dangerous chemicals.  Around this time this policy was introduced, I had to have a total hysterectomy for medical reasons.  Other women at the factory were sterilized so that they could keep their jobs.  When we went back to our jobs those of us who had been sterilized, no matter what the reason, were recognized by everyone in the plant.  The men in the plant knew about the policy and they knew I was sterilized.  Some of them harassed me, making jokes and cruel comments.  For example, shortly after I returned to work, someone put a can in my locker with the message "you didn't have to have it done in the hospital, you could have had it done in the maintenance shop." Some of the men referred to me as "one of the guys." I was so upset by this harassment that my doctor put me on medication for my nerves.

However even with my doctor's authorization, I was laid off without any explanation.  Although I collected unemployment insurance during my layoff, I had to pay for my insurance coverage with my employer.  Because my insurance was better than my husband's, we decided to continue my policy, but it was financially a burden.

However a few years later, after I had been transferred out of the foundry and to a department where there wasn't any lead, I heard that some of the women in the foundry had been sterilized so that they could keep their jobs.  When I was sent back to the foundry, I had to have a blood lead test every three months, and at almost every test the nurse suggested that I have a tubal ligation.  I thought the surgery wasn't necessary because my second husband had a vasectomy.  But I was told that it didn't matter whether or not my husband was sterilized.

One woman who just had a baby was due for promotion and was by-passed.  They told her it was because she had been pregnant.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 I am now pregnant and am especially worried that when I return from maternity leave, I won't have my old job back.  I know that they hired someone else for my position one week after I was transferred to the janitor pool.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 I am the major \b \i0 \ul0 [*100]\b0 \i0 \ul0   supporter of my family.  My husband is presently laid off from his job.  My family depends on my salary and benefits, and it would be disastrous for us if I lost my job before my husband is called back to work.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 I started working in the foundry of an automobile plant in 1972.  At that time I was married and had two small children.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 After I had worked there for about a year, management introduced a policy requiring all women working in high lead areas to have blood lead level tests every three months.  My blood lead level was always low.  However the general foreman in the department wanted to get rid of all the women.  Those of us who were not sterilized had to wear respirators.  I found the respirators very uncomfortable.  It's already hot in the foundry and the respirator just makes you hotter.  In addition, I couldn't find one that fit me right.  The general foreman kept after the women to get sterilized and finally I just decided to have the operation.  Looking back, I regret that I did it.  I come from a big family and I always wanted more children.  At the time I wasn't planning on getting married again and I really needed my job to support the children \b \i0 \ul0 [*101]\b0 \i0 \ul0   I already had.  But as things happened, I did remarry and both my husband and I wanted a child.
