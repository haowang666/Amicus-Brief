\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 STATEMENT OF INTERESTS OF AMICI CURIAE\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This brief amici curiae is submitted on behalf of numerous community-based organizations ("CBOs") that provide assistance and support services to persons with limited or no English-speaking ability. n1 The amici CBOs, in a time of declining budgets and resources, attempt to provide a broad spectrum of services including health care, business and community development, educational \b \i0 \ul0 [*8]\b0 \i0 \ul0   programs, counseling, and employment assistance. n2 CBOs also inform their clients of their rights and obligations under federal and state law. CBOs thus not only assist persons with their immediate needs but also serve as a conduit between federal, state, and local governments and their non-English-speaking constituents by providing information about government and its services. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n1 Pursuant to Sup. Ct. R. 37.3, the parties' letters of consent to the filing of this brief have been filed with the Clerk.
\par \fs20 \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n2 The amici CBOs, including those based in Arizona, and the programs that they provide are described in the Appendix.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The approximately 7 million people in the United States with limited or no proficiency in English n3 constitute one of amici CBOs' principal constituencies. In Arizona alone, 21% of the population over the age of 5 speaks languages other than English at home, including Spanish (14%), German (.6%), Vietnamese (.1%), and several Native American languages (3%). n4 Of these Arizonans, 122,423 (4% of the State's population) have limited or no proficiency in English. n5 These limited English-speaking groups have more difficulty accessing government assistance \b \i0 \ul0 [*9]\b0 \i0 \ul0   and information than English-proficient groups. n6 Amici CBOs are concerned that coercive English-only laws, such as Article XXVIII of the Arizona Constitution ("Article XXVIII"), will further isolate these constituents from their government and the democratic process.

\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n6 One study has shown that families with limited or non-English-speaking heads of household received their welfare checks nearly a week later than English-speaking clients; incurred greater incidental costs in receiving the benefits, such as making extra trips to welfare offices, paying for interpreters, and losing wages due to increased time at the social service agency; and received no information concerning additional sources of assistance such as free legal, educational, or day care assistance.

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Many persons in the United States with limited English proficiency are recent immigrants in search of economic prosperity and participation in a democratic society. Because they have an incentive to learn English to attain these goals, many communities of non-English speakers constitute groups in transition to English proficiency. Non-English-speaking immigrants generally learn English quickly after arriving in the United States, n7 and use English as their primary \b \i0 \ul0 [*11]\b0 \i0 \ul0   or sole language within two or three generations. n8 However, because there is a constant influx of immigrants to the United States, n9 and because discrimination against and inadequate education of language minorities persist, n10 there will always be a need to provide information about government and government services in languages in addition to English.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Amici have witnessed first-hand the difficulties faced by persons with limited English proficiency in accessing information about government and its services. Moreover, amici are gravely concerned that if coercive English-only laws like Article XXVIII are upheld, CBOs will be overwhelmed by non-English-speaking persons who would be cut off from direct access to vital government information and services. n11 Even assuming that CBOs could meet this demand, they would be forced to redirect scarce resources to provide (1) comprehensive translation services for communication between non-English speakers and government employees, and (2) multilingual services and information presently being provided more effectively and efficiently by all levels of government. The result would be not only to exclude non-English speakers from communication with government, but also to undermine the ability of CBOs to continue providing vital programs and assistance to their constituents. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n11 The absence of a coercive English-only law does not impose an affirmative obligation on state or local governments to provide information about rights and services in languages other than English. Rather, it allows these governments or their employees to use other languages to deliver efficiently and effectively information about government services to non-English speakers.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Article XXVIII unconstitutionally impairs the First Amendment rights of both government employees and non-English-speaking Arizonans by banning protected speech -- in this case, the communication of information about government and its services in any language other than English. n12 Article XXVIII applies to all government officials and employees in the performance of government business. It therefore prohibits state officials and employees from speaking languages other than English with non-English-speaking constituents, a form of communication which the State has conceded improves efficiency. Article XXVIII also requires English as the language of public schools. Accordingly, it restricts the use of bilingual education, which has been widely recognized as the most effective method of teaching limited English-proficient children. Because Article XXVIII's broad sweep imposes an English-only requirement on state statutes, rules, programs and policies, it precludes the dissemination in languages other than English of information on various educational, public health and welfare programs which are designed to benefit all Arizonans. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n12 Article XXVIII of the Arizona Constitution was passed as a ballot initiative in 1988. See Yniguez v. Arizonans for Official English, 69 F.3d 920, 924 (9th Cir. 1995) (en banc), cert. granted, 64 U.S.L.W. 3635 (U.S. Mar. 25, 1996). As other amici compelling argue, Article XXVIII violates the First Amendment rights of Ms. Yniguez and other public employees by prohibiting them from conveying government information and services to the public in any language other than English. See Brief of Amici Curiae American Civil Liberties Union et al. Amici CBOs will not repeat these arguments here. Instead, amici CBOs focus their legal argument on the impact of Article XXVIII on the First Amendment rights of non-English-speaking Arizonans. See Brief for Petitioners [hereinafter Pet. Br.] at 25-26.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  \b \i0 \ul0 [*14]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Article XXVIII would shift to CBOs the burden of serving as primary providers of information about government to non-English-speaking Arizonans. CBOs already face limited funding for the services they provide, and this shift would likely result in a reduction in other forms of assistance for their constituents. Moreover, because the State would cede control of delivering its message to non-English speakers, information about government services may not be presented as effectively as if provided directly by the State itself.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Article XXVIII violates the First Amendment rights of non-English speakers in Arizona by erecting a barrier to their ability to receive information and ideas from their state and local governments. Article XXVIII also suppresses the flow of truthful information for the paternalistic purpose of compelling Arizonans to learn English. It does so by "hiding" information about government services and functions from non-English-speaking Arizonans. By denying access to information and impeding the free flow of information, Article XXVIII hinders non-English-speaking Arizonans' ability to participate in democratic society. In effect, it silences them, and silences government \b \i0 \ul0 [*15]\b0 \i0 \ul0   employees by preventing them from serving as sources of vital information. Such enforced silence is contrary to our Nation's commitment, embodied in the First Amendment, to the ideal of a free exchange of ideas and flow of information.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Article XXVIII's suppression of speech about government and government services does not promote any of the state interests asserted by Petitioners. Article XXVIII does not promote governmental "legitimacy." A legitimate democratic government serves all its constituents whether or not they speak English. Article XXVIII also does not promote national unity. To the contrary, it would divide society into those able to participate in government and those incapable of doing so. Nor does Article XXVIII foster a common language. English is -- and will continue to be -- the predominant language of the United States, which all attempt to learn in order to take advantage of the opportunities available in Arizona and the United States. For these reasons, Article XXVIII is repugnant to the First Amendment and our nation's democratic traditions. This Court should affirm the Ninth Circuit's decision invalidating Article XXVIII.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 I. ARTICLE\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b \i0 \ul0 [*16]\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b \i0 \ul0  XXVIII FORECLOSES DIRECT ACCESS TO INFORMATION BY AND ABOUT GOVERNMENT FOR ARIZONANS WITH LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 "Whatever differences may exist about interpretations of the First Amendment, there is practically universal agreement that a major purpose of that Amendment was to protect the free discussion of governmental affairs." n13 Landmark Communications, Inc. v. Virginia, 435 U.S. 829, 838 (1978) (quoting Mills v. Alabama, 384 U.S. 214, 218 (1966)). Article XXVIII inhibits "the free discussion of governmental affairs" because it purposefully deprives non-English-speaking Arizonans of access to information about the government when multilingual access is necessary "to ensure fair and effective delivery of governmental services to non-English speakers." n14 Moreover, Article XXVIII would make the State's policy on the use of English inconsistent with federal law and policy, which do not require that immigrants to the United States, including those residing in Arizona, know English as a condition to entry. n15 See 8 U.S.C. \'a7\'a7 1101 et seq. (1994). 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n13 "Free discussion" necessarily implies protection not only for the speaker and provider of information but also for the audience and consumer of information. See, e.g., Virginia State Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, 425 U.S. 748, 756 (1976) (First Amendment protection extends to "the communication, its source and to its recipients both").

\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n14 Op. Att'y Gen. Az., 189-009, at 7 (1989), reprinted in Joint Appendix [hereinafter J.A.] at 71. The Arizona Attorney General's opinion construed Article XXVIII to be applicable only to "official acts of government." (J.A. 76.) This opinion, however, is not binding on Arizona courts. See Yniguez, 69 F.3d at 928-29.
\par \fs20 \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n15 The Clinton Administration has opposed recent attempts to adopt an English-only law at the federal level. See Letter from Andrew Fois, Ass't Att'y Gen., U.S. Dep't of Justice, to Hon. Ted Stevens, Chairman of the Senate Comm. on Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate 2 (May 14, 1996) (on file with counsel for amici) ("The passage of [The Language of Government Act] would decrease administrative efficiency and exclude Americans who are not fully proficient in English from education, employment, voting and equal participation in our society.").
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Arizona government at both state and local levels has recognized the importance of ensuring that non-English-speakers are able to receive important information in a comprehensible form about, inter alia, education, legislative matters, consumer protection, health care, and public benefits by providing \b \i0 \ul0 [*18]\b0 \i0 \ul0   information in languages other than English. n16 This information is essential to both English and non-English speakers, and the broad dissemination of this information to all segments of society benefits the entire state. By prohibiting public employees and all state agencies from communicating information in languages other than English, Article XXVIII denies access to this vast body of information by the non-English-speaking public. n17
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n16 At the federal level, Congress has implemented laws to protect the rights of non-English speakers to receive government information, and has taken affirmative steps to enable the non-English-speaking public to participate in meaningful communication with the government. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \'a7 1973aa-1a(b) (1994) (requiring bilingual voting materials for certain non-English speaking populations); 20 U.S.C. \'a7\'a7 7401-7602 (1994) (providing funds to help states educate language minority residents); 42 U.S.C. \'a7\'a7 254b(f)(3)(J), 254c(e)(3)(J) (1994) (requiring identification of bilingual staff members in federally-funded migrant and community health centers where there are substantial number of limited English-speaking clients).
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  \b \i0 \ul0 [*19]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n17 Article XXVIII's exceptions are limited and vague: non-English languages may be used to protect the rights of criminal defendants and victims, to protect public health or safety, to teach a foreign language, and to comply with federal laws. Art. XXVIII, \'a7 3(2). Article XXVIII provides no guidance on how these exceptions are to be applied, yet, permits suits by private citizens to enforce the "official" use of English. Id. \'a7 4. In those instances where a state employee must interpret Article XXVIII's boundaries, the threat of employee sanctions and Article XXVIII's private right of enforcement would deter state employees from using any language other than English. See, e.g., J.A. 86 (Ms. Yniguez ceased using Spanish on the job out of fear that "it would be contrary to the amendment" and "someone could bring a lawsuit against me").
\par \fs20 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A. Article XXVIII Impairs Communication with State Employees and Elected Officials in Languages Other Than English.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The examples of Ms. Yniguez and Senator Gutierrez illustrate the unreasonable barriers that Article XXVIII would place before limited English-speaking Arizonans seeking to receive government information or services. On behalf \b \i0 \ul0 [*20]\b0 \i0 \ul0   of the Risk Management Division, Maria-Kelley Yniguez spoke in Spanish to Spanish-speaking people who were asserting medical malpractice claims against the State of Arizona. (J.A. 45-46.) In the course of her official duties, Ms. Yniguez also prepared legal documents in Spanish so that Spanish-speaking citizens who were unable to read English could understand the legal import of the documents they were asked to sign. (J.A. 48.) Ms. Yniguez spoke Spanish on the job with the consent of her supervisors; in fact, at the request of her supervisors, Ms. Yniguez used her bilingual skills to help investigate other claims made against the State of Arizona. (J.A. 46.)
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Article XXVIII applies to "all government officials and employees during the performance of government business." Art. XXVIII, \'a7 1(3)(a)(iv). It would thus prohibit bilingual employees like Ms. Yniguez from speaking Spanish on the job, and would thereby foreclose the most efficient form of government communication with non-English speakers. As Ms. Yniguez herself noted: "If I am not permitted to communicate in the Spanish language with persons who speak the Spanish language but not the English language, I will be denied the \b \i0 \ul0 [*21]\b0 \i0 \ul0   opportunity to obtain and disseminate information which is of public importance and interest." (J.A. 46.) The absurdity of Article XXVIII, and the waste of resources it would engender is obvious: a private citizen would be needed to translate a conversation between a Spanish speaker and Ms. Yniguez about a medical malpractice claim, even though Ms. Yniguez could speak directly to the Spanish speaker in Spanish.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Similarly, state legislators such as Senator Jaime Gutierrez have relied on their foreign language skills to ensure that their non-English-speaking constituents are not denied access to the government. (J.A. 78-79.) Senator Gutierrez has used Spanish with his non-English-speaking constituents to provide "educational material regarding State government," and to permit "entry or access into State government for resolution of whatever types of problems one may have." (Id. at 79.) However, Article XXVIII applies to the "Legislative, Executive and Judicial branches of government," Art. XXVIII, \'a7 1(3)(a), and mandates that the English language is the language of "all government functions and actions," id., \'a7 1(2). Article XXVIII would thus ban legislators from speaking with or \b \i0 \ul0 [*22]\b0 \i0 \ul0   writing to their constituents in any language other than English. See Yniguez, 69 F.3d at 950 (Brunetti, J., concurring). Even though State representatives may share fluency in a non-English language with their constituents, they would not be allowed to communicate in that language to describe legislative developments or proposed legislation, or to seek input on what actions they should take on their constituents' behalf -- communication at the core of the First Amendment and our democratic form of government.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Article XXVIII restricts educational opportunities by preventing Arizonan children with limited or no proficiency in English from receiving bilingual education -- widely regarded as the most effective form of language instruction. Many educators agree that incorporating the student's native language in teaching is the best method to achieve fluency in both English and the student's native language in the shortest amount of time, and still ensure that the student learns the substantive content of the subject being taught. n18 Article XXVIII ignores these findings \b \i0 \ul0 [*23]\b0 \i0 \ul0   -- with no justification except to coerce the use of English -- and requires English to be the language of the public schools. Art. XXVIII, \'a7 1(2). As a result, over 90,000 K-12 students in Arizona n19 would be denied the most effective form of educational instruction. n20 Arizona school districts that have successfully educated language minority youths in the past through the use of native language instruction would be forced to abandon bilingual education. Therefore, Article XXVIII would effectively ban the option of bilingual education and require less effective means for educating non-English-speaking students.

The use of bilingual instruction, however, reduced this time to four to seven years.

\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n20 Article XXVIII purports to create an exception to English-only instruction "to assist students who are not proficient in the English language, to the extent necessary to comply with federal law, by giving educational instruction in a language other than English to provide as rapid as possible a transition to English." Art. XXVIII, \'a7 3(2)(a). This exception, however, is meaningless because federal law does not specifically mandate native language instruction; it only requires that (1) school districts provide sound educational programming to limited English proficient students through which they can acquire English language skills, and (2) the educational program produces results indicating that the language barriers are being overcome. See Castaneda v. Pickard, 648 F.2d 989, 1009-11 (5th Cir. 1981).
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Article XXVIII undermines the educational process in other ways as well. Non-English-speaking parents already face great difficulty participating in their children's education. See 20 U.S.C. \'a7 7402(a)(5)(C) (1994). Article XXVIII would increase that difficulty because it appears to preclude public school teachers from communicating directly \b \i0 \ul0 [*25]\b0 \i0 \ul0   with non-English-speaking parents in languages other than English. Although educators have found that a student's academic performance is strongly affected by the parents' participation in the child's schooling, n21 Article XXVIII removes this critical support from the child's education.

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Article XXVIII would also harshly impact non-English-speaking families with children in special education programs. The State of Arizona currently requires each local educational agency ("LEA") and State-supported institution ("SSI") to provide information regarding the rights of handicapped children in a language comprehensible to the parents, regardless of their ethnic, linguistic, or cultural background. Ariz. Admin. Code \'a7 R7-2-401(B)(1) (1995). All communications from the LEA or SSI to the language minority parents about any special education \b \i0 \ul0 [*26]\b0 \i0 \ul0   matter must be in the primary language of the home. Id. \'a7 R7-2-401(C)(7). Furthermore, the State must provide an interpreter during an individualized education program planning conference if either the parent or child has limited English proficiency. Id. \'a7 R7-2-401(F)(3). These services are designed to increase the parents' level of participation in the educational process to ensure that children receive an effective education. These services are not likely to be available because Article XXVIII precludes state employees from using any language other than English.
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 C. Article XXVIII Suppresses the Dissemination of Information Intended to Promote Public Awareness and Welfare.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Recognizing that providing information only in English does not adequately inform all Arizonans, the State of Arizona has adopted laws and regulations to ensure that the non-English-speaking public understands basic information about their rights and responsibilities. These laws are likely to be declared unconstitutional under Article XXVIII. See Art. XXVIII, \'a7 1(3)(a)(iii) (English-only requirement applies to "all statutes, ordinances, rules, orders, programs and policies").
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 For example, Arizona \b \i0 \ul0 [*27]\b0 \i0 \ul0   currently requires all businesses that process consumer loans to post conspicuous signs in English and Spanish stating that legally-required disclosures must be provided in Spanish at the borrower's request. Ariz. Rev. Stat. \'a7 6-651(A)(2) (1995). It would be inconsistent with Article XXVIII for the State to mandate that private organizations publish consumer protection notices in any language other than English. Language minorities would thus be placed at a substantial disadvantage in situations where the State itself has recognized a critical need for consumers to be aware of their rights in order to make informed decisions.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In the area of health care, Arizona requires that patients with serious medical or mental conditions must be informed of their rights in a language which they understand. n22 Without this support, the most vulnerable members of society are left to fend for themselves since they would not be aware of the rights and protections that they are entitled to receive by law. n23

\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n23 Article XXVIII includes an exception "to protect public health or safety." Art. XXVIII, \'a7 3(2)(d). However, neither the nature nor the beneficiaries of this "protection" have been delineated.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Non-English-speaking Arizonans would even be foreclosed under Article XXVIII from obtaining the knowledge necessary to exercise basic rights and benefits enjoyed by English-speaking Arizonans. Currently, government agencies print information in Spanish on a variety of topics, including energy conservation, the rights of utility customers, gang membership deterrences, accessing emergency medical services, obtaining health care for children of low-income families, and maintenance of privately-owned gas pipelines served by public utilities. n24 Providing such information in languages other than English is likely to be foreclosed by Article XXVIII because it requires the use of English by "all political subdivisions, departments, agencies, organizations, and instrumentalities" of the State. Art. XXVIII, \'a7 1(3)(a)(ii).

However, by requiring the use of only English, Article XXVIII cleaves society into those able to obtain and understand such government information and non-English speakers who must turn elsewhere--most likely to CBOs--to receive the same information, to the detriment of society as a whole.

\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n25 In addition to requiring the use of only English by the State, its officials, agencies and employees, Article XXVIII provides all persons residing or doing business within the State with the right to sue to enforce its English-only restrictions. Art. XXVIII, \'a7 4. This private right of enforcement would have a direct chilling effect not only on state employees like Ms. Yniguez (see J.A. 52), but also on all persons or entities within the State at any point of communication with the State or its representatives.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In a time of declining resources and increasing demand for assistance, Article XXVIII would force CBOs to assume the additional burden of serving as primary providers of information about government to non-English-speaking Arizonans. n26 CBOs already face difficulty in meeting the present demand for these services. Article XXVIII would create the need for CBOs to expand translation services in order for non-English speakers to obtain information about government and government services. To the extent that CBOs are called on to serve as interpreters, they would pay a substantial price in funds and employees diverted from other much-needed programs such as: immunization clinics; child care; educational services; assistance to domestic violence victims; legalization and naturalization services; employment counseling; developing, renovating and providing housing for low-income families; mental health services and counseling; and substance abuse prevention and treatment. Ultimately, the cost of Article XXVIII would be borne by the constituents of CBOs in the form of reduced assistance. Thus, by shifting the burden to convey government information \b \i0 \ul0 [*31]\b0 \i0 \ul0   to CBOs, Article XXVIII increases the likelihood that the government's message will not be received. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n26 The State of Arizona could not condition funding for CBOs on the use of only English in the provision of services without violating the CBOs' First Amendment rights.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Foreclosing direct access to communication with the Arizona government does not erase the acute need of non-English-speaking residents for government information and services. Therefore, to communicate with or to receive information about the government of Arizona, many more non-English-speaking Arizonans will turn to CBOs. Article XXVIII, in effect, forces the State to cede control of its message and to rely on third parties with less familiarity and understanding about government programs to communicate directly with non-English speakers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Even assuming that translation-on-demand would be available to non-English speakers (and without a corresponding reduction in other forms of \b \i0 \ul0 [*32]\b0 \i0 \ul0   assistance), there is no assurance that the government's message will be accurately translated or fully communicated by CBOs. While misinterpretation would certainly not be intentional, it is likely to occur, particularly when the information being translated is technical in nature or concerns complex issues. For instance, Ms. Yniguez, based on her experience in investigating medical malpractice claims involving the State, is in a better position than employees of CBOs to communicate information concerning the State's procedures for resolving such claims.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Nor will a literal translation of the government's message always be sufficient. In many cases, it would be important to convey the proper context and background along with the particular facts being communicated. For example, the description of a particular aspect of bringing a medical malpractice claim against the State may take on a fuller or even different meaning if accompanied by an explanation of the tort law of Arizona or administrative proceedings in general. The government employee representing a particular agency or program is in the best position to convey the message and its context--not the third-party interpreter.  \b \i0 \ul0 [*33]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Moreover, Article XXVIII reduces government's and society's stake in ensuring that all persons participate directly in democratic society, and compels CBOs to assume the role of intermediaries between the non-English-speaking public and government. n27 In contrast to the government as provider of this information, the numerous CBOs providing information to non-English-speaking Arizonans are likely to interpret the information differently and place it in different contexts. Ultimately, if CBOs become the primary source of information about government and the services it provides, the information will not be presented in a unified voice or as accurately as it would were the government the sole, multilingual speaker. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n27 Because Article XXVIII would force the state to abdicate its responsibility to provide information to non-English speakers, CBOs may be hesitant to refer non-English speakers to the government for assistance. If no translation service were available, it would be futile to send non-English-speaking clients to a government office.

\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0 A popular government, without popular information or the means of acquiring it, is but a prologue to a farce or tragedy; or perhaps both.

This Court has since recognized in a number of different contexts the fundamental importance of the "right to know." It first clearly identified the right in Lamont v. Postmaster Gen., 381 U.S. 301 (1965), when it upheld the right of citizens to receive "foreign communist propaganda" from abroad without having to notify the government. n28 Echoing James Madison's sentiments, Justice Brennan declared that "the dissemination of ideas \b \i0 \ul0 [*35]\b0 \i0 \ul0   can accomplish nothing if otherwise willing addressees are not free to receive and consider them.

\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n28 The Court, however, has traced the genesis of the right to know to the early eighteenth century. In Grosjean v. American Press Co., 297 U.S. 233, 240 (1936), the Court described in detail the history leading to the adoption of the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. In 1712, the British Parliament imposed a "knowledge tax" on all newspapers and advertisements to suppress comments and criticisms objectionable to the Crown. Many citizens of England and the American Colonies protested this tax because it interfered with their ability "to establish and preserve [their] right to . . . full information in respect to the doings and misdoings of their government." Id. at 247. From this experience, the Framers drafted the Free Speech Clause to prevent "'any action of the government by means of which it might prevent such free and general discussion of public matters as seems absolutely essential to prepare the people for an intelligent exercise of their rights as citizens.'" Id. at 249-50 (quoting 2 Thomas M. Cooley, A Treatise on the Constitutional Limitations 886 (8th ed. 1927)).

"This right to receive information and ideas is fundamental to our free society." Id.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 At the heart of the right to know recognized in Lamont, Griswold, and Stanley is the ability to receive information and ideas about the government and its business. n29 This right protects "the free discussion of governmental affairs." Landmark Communications, 435 U.S. at 838. \b \i0 \ul0 [*37]\b0 \i0 \ul0   By purposefully depriving language minorities of access to information about governmental affairs and services, Article XXVIII unconstitutionally abridges non-English-speaking Arizonans' right to know and inhibits participation in the "free discussion" of issues and ideas at the core of the First Amendment. n30

Moreover, through Article XXVIII, the State of Arizona would impermissibly impair individual rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution to Arizona residents. If there is any principle which stands clear, it is surely that neither Arizona nor any other state can abridge the individual liberties protected by the Bill of Rights in the name of "states' rights."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The corollary to the right to receive information and ideas is the principle that the government does not have broad discretion to impose laws that purposefully suppress truthful, nonmisleading information merely for paternalistic purposes. 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 116 S. Ct. 1495, 1508 (1996); Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 403 (1923). "The First Amendment directs us to be especially skeptical of regulations that seek to keep people in the dark for what the government perceives to be their own good." 44 Liquormart, 116 S. Ct. at 1508. Article XXVIII does just that by "hiding" truthful information from non-English-speaking citizens in an effort to force them to speak English "for their own good."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This Court has most often articulated this concern with hiding truthful information in the context of restrictions on the right of citizens to receive information on commercial transactions.

In striking down Rhode Island's statutory prohibition against advertisements that provided the public with accurate information about retail prices of alcoholic beverages, this Court stated that "bans that target truthful, nonmisleading commercial messages . . . not only hinder consumer choice, but also impede debate over central issues of public policy." 44 Liquormart, 116 S.

In fact, this alleged State interest is merely a euphemism for Petitioners' blatantly discriminatory attempt to exclude linguistic minorities from the democratic process, which is not a "legitimate" State interest at all. See Romer v. Evans, 116 S. Ct. 1620 (1996).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In the one case that Petitioners cite for this assertion, United States v. International Union United Auto. Workers, 352 U.S. 567 (1957), this Court upheld a statute intended to protect the role of individuals and minorities in the electoral process by prohibiting contributions by corporations and unions to electoral campaigns for federal office. The teaching of that case, if at all relevant in this context, is that government promotes its "legitimacy" by not adopting the majority view when necessary to ensure that the voice of the minority is heard. Article XXVIII does the precise opposite by ensuring that only the voice of the majority is heard, to the detriment of non-English speakers. As Congressman Mineta noted regarding a proposed \b \i0 \ul0 [*43]\b0 \i0 \ul0   English Language Amendment to the United States Constitution, English-only laws "set up a class of 'outsiders'--unable to communicate with their government, and their government unable to communicate with them--all based on language skills." n31

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Petitioners illustrate the alleged state interest in governmental legitimacy with the story of an English speaker unable to find someone at a government office who spoke her language. Pet. Br. at 36. Were the languages simply reversed, this story represents exactly the circumstances in which non-English speakers in Arizona would find themselves in an English-only government. n32 Moreover, using Petitioners' reasoning, this scenario illustrates the perception of governmental "illegitimacy" that linguistic minorities in Arizona would hold if the State mandates that its employees speak only English. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n32 The burden of coercive language choice on the rights of non-English-speaking Arizonans is readily apparent by taking Petitioners' argument to its logical conclusion. Petitioners claim that "Arizona may choose the language in which it will speak." Pet. Br. at 20. If, for example, the State legislature required all government communication in only Navajo, to encourage persons in the State to appreciate the contributions and heritage of Navajo culture to Arizona, such a language choice law would surely be struck down as impermissibly burdening the right of non-Navajo-speaking Arizonans to participate in the "free discussion of governmental affairs."
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  \b \i0 \ul0 [*44]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Ultimately, legitimacy of government is not promoted by adopting a constitutional amendment which "officially" denies the existence of language minorities, and "officially" imposes a unified, English-only facade for Arizonans. The State of Arizona must serve all Arizonans, not just those who need reassurance that the State speaks like the English-speaking majority. Article XXVIII permits the government to abdicate its responsibility to ensure that all its constituents participate in democratic government and allows it to rely on the altruism of private parties such as CBOs to communicate with non-English-speaking Arizonans. While CBOs serve language minorities in many ways, they cannot substitute for government itself.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 While national unity has been deemed a legitimate government interest in certain contexts, n33 Article XXVIII, by coercion, does not promote that interest. n34 Language alone cannot promote national unity. Without other, more important common bonds, such as the belief in a democratic form of government and equality of opportunity, a common language would be of little use. n35 For \b \i0 \ul0 [*45]\b0 \i0 \ul0   example, sociolinguist Karl Deutsch has found that language is not a necessary or sufficient condition for a sense of nationalism.

\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n34 See id. ("The problem is whether under our Constitution compulsion as here employed is a permissible means for its achievement.").

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Furthermore, Article XXVIII is not needed to promote use of a common language. America already has a common language -- English. The 1990 United States census statistics show that only 3.1% of the census respondents do not speak English well or very well. n37 Given the widespread acceptance and use of English, n38 it is an essential role of government to recognize the existence of linguistic minorities and strive to ensure their participation in and access to government.

Barnette, 319 U.S. at 641. The Court recognized the ultimate futility of such attempts to compel unity "from the Roman drive to stamp out Christianity as a disturber of its pagan unity,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*48]\b0 \i0 \ul0   the Inquisition, as a means to religious and dynastic unity, [and] the Siberian exiles as a means to Russian unity."
