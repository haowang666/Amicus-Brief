\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 INTERESTS:\b0 \i0 \ul0  Amici are two Caucuses of the United States Congress, one national organization of state and local elected and appointed officials, 32 individual United States Senators and Representatives not affiliated with the Caucuses, and one state legislator from New Mexico who is currently campaigning for the United States Congress. Together, these amici represent over 42 million people in this country, including over 2.9 million people who are not proficient in English or who do not speak English at all.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 INTEREST OF AMICI CURIAE
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Amici are interested in and directly affected by this case for two reasons. First, a provision such as Article XXVIII of the Arizona Constitution ("Article XXVIII") would substantially impede the ability of legislators to communicate with -- and thereby represent -- their constituents who are not proficient in English. Second, because a number of "official English" provisions are currently pending in Congress, amici wish this Court to be aware of the practical effect of such provisions on legislators before it rules on their constitutionality. The purpose of this brief, therefore, is to demonstrate that practical effect and to show why that effect violates the First Amendment rights of elected representatives in this country.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Congressional Hispanic Caucus ("CHC") is an informal bipartisan group of 18 Members of Congress of Hispanic descent. CHC is dedicated to voicing and advancing, through the legislative process, issues affecting Hispanic Americans in the United States and the insular areas. Founded in 1976 as a legislative service organization of the United States House of Representatives, CHC is now organized as a congressional member organization, governed under the Rules of Congress. The following CHC member United States Representatives join as amici: Nydia M. Velazquez (12th Dist., New York), Xavier Becerra (30th Dist., California), Lincoln Diaz-Balart (21st Dist., Florida), E (Kika) de la Garza (15th Dist., Texas), Henry B. Gonzalez (20th Dist., Texas), Luis V. Gutierrez (4th Dist., Illinois), Robert Menendez (13th Dist., New Jersey), Solomon P. Ortiz (27th Dist., Texas), Ed Pastor (2nd Dist., Arizona), Bill Richardson (3rd Dist., New Mexico), Carlos Romero-Barcelo (Puerto Rico), Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (18th Dist., Florida), Lucille Roybal-Allard (33rd Dist., California), Jose E. Serrano (16th Dist., New York), Frank Tejeda (28th Dist., Texas), Esteban E. Torres (34th Dist., California), and Robert Underwood (Guam).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus ("CAPAC") is a group of ten members of Congress which was founded in 1994 to increase and enhance the ability of Members of Congress and their allies to represent effectively the Asian American and Pacific Islander community's concerns in policy debates. The following members of CAPAC join as amici: United States Senators Daniel K. Akaka (Hawaii) and Daniel K. Inouye (Hawaii) and United States Representatives Neil Abercrombie (1st Dist., Hawaii), Eni F.H. Faleomavaega (Samoa), Robert T. Matsui (5th Dist., California), Patsy T. Mink (2nd Dist., Hawaii), Nancy Pelosi (8th Dist., California), and Robert Underwood (Guam).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials ("NALEO") is a non-partisan, national organization which seeks to advance the health, social, economic, and educational welfare of Americans of Hispanic origin or descent. NALEO provides information and assistance on legislative and governmental actions affecting Hispanics and other disadvantaged groups. The membership of NALEO is open to all individuals committed to the objectives of the organization. NALEO has approximately 300 members, including Members of Congress and elected and appointed state and local officials. Several members of CHC are also members of NALEO.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The following members of the United States Congress who are not members of either CHC or CAPAC but share concerns about the constitutionality of Article XXVIII also join this brief as amici: Senators Edward M. Kennedy (Massachusetts), Carol Moseley-Braun (Illinois) and Paul Simon (Illinois), and Representatives Howard L. Berman (26th Dist., California), James E. Clybum (6th Dist., South Carolina), Ronald D. Coleman (16th Dist., Texas), John Conyers, Jr. (14th Dist., Michigan), Ronald V. Dellums (9th Dist., California), Julian C. Dixon (32nd Dist., California), Sam Farr (17th Dist., California), Chaka Fattah (2nd Dist., Pennsylvania), Floyd H. Flake (6th Dist., New York), Victor O. Frazer (Virgin Islands), Alcee L. Hastings (23rd Dist., Florida), Jesse Jackson, Jr. (2nd Dist., Illinois), Matthew G. Martinez (31st Dist., California), Jim McDermott (7th Dist., Washington), Cynthia McKinney (11th Dist., Georgia), Carrie Meek (17th Dist., Florida), Jerrold Nadler (8th Dist., New York), Eleanor Holmes Norton (District of Columbia), John W. Olver (1st Dist., Massachusetts), Major R. Owens (11th Dist., New York), Donald M. Payne (10th Dist., New Jersey), Charles B. Rangel (15th Dist., New York), Patricia Schroeder (1st Dist., Colorado), Louise M. Slaughter (28th Dist., New York), Pete Stark (13th Dist., California), Edolphus Towns (10th Dist., New York), Maxine Waters (35th Dist., California), Melvn L. Watt, (12th Dist., North Carolina), and Albert R. Wynn (4th Dist., Maryland). In total, 56 Members of Congress join this brief as amici. In addition, New Mexico State Representative E. Shirley Baca, who is currently campaigning for the United States Congress, also joins as amicus.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 TITLE: \b0 \i0 \ul0 BRIEF OF AMICI CURIAE UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE NYDIA M. VELAZQUEZ, CONGRESSIONAL HISPANIC CAUCUS, CONGRESSIONAL ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN CAUCUS, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF LATINO ELECTED AND APPOINTED OFFICIALS AND 32 INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS AS AMICI CURIAE IN SUPPORT OF RESPONDENTS
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Article XXVIII is unlike provisions of other state laws that merely proclaim English to be the state's "official" language. Instead, the broad terms of Article XXVIII place a prohibition on governmental communications in any language other than English, a prohibition that, as the Ninth Circuit held, includes communications between elected officials and their constituents.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Amici, who are legislators and other elected officials, communicate every day with countless of their constituents in languages other than English. If amici were limited to speaking in English only, they would be unable to represent effectively the entirety of their constituencies because many of their constituents are not proficient in English. Communications with constituents by amici Members of Congress, many of whom were members of state legislatures before joining the Congress, vividly illustrate the types of communications that a provision like Article XXVIII would prohibit if it were allowed to stand. These communications, conducted personally by amici, and through staff, are necessary for legislative fact finding and to inform amici's political \b \i0 \ul0 [*6]\b0 \i0 \ul0   debate; for providing necessary services to constituents; and for communicating with the electorate during political campaigns. Article XXVIII would shut off all of these communications and leave legislators without information necessary to represent non-English speaking portions of their constituencies, and leave these constituents without vital information about the business of our government.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Such a result plainly violates the First Amendment. Free speech between legislators and their constituents is central to our democratic system, and is entitled to the greatest measure of protection under our Constitution. As this Court has held, the state simply has no interest in limiting the capacity of a legislator to discuss matters of public policy with his constituents.  Bond v. Floyd, 385 U.S. 116 (1966). Yet this is precisely what Article XXVIII does by prohibiting legislators from communicating with their constituents in languages other than English. In addition, Article XXVIII violates the First Amendment rights of legislators by limiting their capacity to discuss issues of public policy with their constituents as they relate to election campaigns -- political speech \b \i0 \ul0 [*7]\b0 \i0 \ul0   that is also entitled to the greatest protection under the First Amendment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Article XXVIII is also contrary to the historical backdrop of the First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment, both of which were enacted against our historical tradition of governmental actors communicating with their constituents in languages other than English. Our long history of legislators speaking with their constituents in languages other than English also believes the arguments made by Petitioners and their amici that our democracy is threatened by allowing legislators who wish to do so to communicate with their constituents in languages other than English.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Amici believe that all people in this country should be encouraged to learn English so that they may participate to the fullest extent in our national political life. Amici also believe that non-English-speaking Americans have vital contributions to make to our political discourse, and should not be prevented from participating in our government while they work to become fluent in English. Petitioners present no cogent reason, much less a compelling one, why those who do not speak English, who are citizens and tax payers, should be prevented \b \i0 \ul0 [*8]\b0 \i0 \ul0   from participating in the political process and shut off from communicating with the legislators whom they elected to represent their interests. Article XXVIII's prohibition on such communications violates the First Amendment and should not be allowed to stand.
\par \pard 
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 ARGUMENT\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I. ARTICLE XXVIII VIOLATES THE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS OF LEGISLATORS BY INHIBITING THEIR ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR CONSTITUENTS IN LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 By prohibiting all government officials and employees from using any language other than English when communicating with the people they serve, Article XXVIII is more restrictive than any other "official English" provision in existence in our country. As the Ninth Circuit expressly held, Article XXVIII even limits communications between legislators and their constituents. The experience of amici, as shown below, illustrates the numerous kinds of communications between legislators and their constituents that would be inhibited by Article XXVIII. Such inhibitions on speech, as also shown below, plainly violate the First Amendment.
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A. The Broad Terms of Article XXVIII Limit Speech by Legislators to Their Constituents\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Even \b \i0 \ul0 [*9]\b0 \i0 \ul0   to those who might otherwise favor adoption of English as an "official language," the breadth of Article XXVIII is, quite simply, astounding. n1 Section 1 of Article XXVIII declares English to be the "official language of . . . all government and actions," and states that Article XXVIII applies to "the legislative, executive and judicial branches of government," and to "all government officials . . . during the performance of government business." Article XXVIII, \'a7 1. Section 3 of Article XXVIII then provides that (with certain exceptions not here relevant) "this State . . . shall act in English and no other language." Article XXVIII, \'a7 3(1)(a). As the Ninth Circuit held, Article XXVIII's "plain language broadly prohibits all government officials and employees from speaking languages other than English in performing their official duties . . . ." Yniguez v. Arizonans for Official English, 69 F.3d 920, 931 (9th Cir. 1995) (en banc). And as the Ninth Circuit also held, the broad terms of Article XXVIII clearly encompass non-English speech by legislators in the course of performing their duties as representatives of the people.  Id. at 932 ("Article XXVIII \b \i0 \ul0 [*10]\b0 \i0 \ul0   on its face applies to speech in a seemingly limitless variety of governmental settings [including] town-hall discussions between constituents and their representatives"). 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n1 By providing that all governmental communications may be in English only, Article XXVIII is uniquely restrictive when compared to other state provisions establishing English as the state's "official language." Indeed, the official English provisions of four states expressly allow governmental communications in languages other than English. See 1995 Mont. Laws 319; Va. Code Ann. \'a7 7.1-42; 1996 Wyo. Sess. Laws 34; Puerto Rican Org. for Political Action v. Kusper, 490 F.2d 575 (7th Cir. 1973) (interpreting Illinois' "official-English" statute).
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Thirteen other states have either passed legislation or amended their constitutions to establish English as their official language, without any further elaboration. See Ala. Const. amend. 509; Ark. Code Ann. \'a7 1-4-117 (Michie 1987); Cal. Const. art. III, \'a7 6; Colo. Const. art. II, \'a7 30a; Fla. Const. art. II, \'a7 9; 1986 Ga. Laws 529; Haw. Const. art. XV, \'a7 4; Ind. Code Ann. \'a7 1-2-10-1 (West 1996); Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. \'a7 2.013 (Baldwin 1996); Miss. Code Ann. \'a7 3-3-31 (1993); Neb. Const. art. I, \'a7 27; N.C. Gen. Stat. \'a7 145-12; N.D. Cent. Code \'a7 54-02-13. The essentially symbolic nature of many of these laws (Arkansas, Hawaii, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, North Dakota, South Carolina (S.C. Code Ann. \'a7 1-1-696 (Law Co-op 1993)) and South Dakota (S.D. Codified Laws Ann. \'a7 1-27-20 (1996))) is emphasized by their placement in sections of their respective state codes relating to other symbols such as the state bird, song, or motto.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  \b \i0 \ul0 [*11]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Accordingly, Petitioners' amici, the Washington Legal Foundation, et al. ("WLF"), are wrong to contend that Article XXVIII applies only to the "legislative function" of legislators, and does not affect speech between legislators and their constituents. See Brief of the Washington Legal Foundation, et al. as Amici Curiae in Support of Petitioners ("WLF Brief") at 7. Certainly, nothing in the language of Article XXVIII or the Ninth Circuit's construction of it supports that view. n2 In fact, the only authorities WLF cites in support of the purported limitation of Article XXVIII to "legislative acts" address the entirely different issue of the reach of the Speech or Debate Clause in the United States Constitution and the analogous provision of the Arizona Constitution. See, e.g., United States v. Brewster, 408 U.S. 501 (1972); Gravel v. United States, 408 U.S. 606 (1972). Using this inapposite body of law, WLF concludes first that Article XXVIII, as applied to legislators, reaches only speech on the floor of the legislative chamber and in legislative committees, and then concludes that a prohibition on non-English speech within that sphere raises no difficulty \b \i0 \ul0 [*12]\b0 \i0 \ul0   under the First Amendment. WLF Brief at 8-10. But, if Article XXVIII were intended to reach no farther than speech used on the floor of the legislative chamber and in committee hearings -- which is certainly not what the language of Article XXVIII states -- the provision would apply only to speech that may not be regulated under the Arizona equivalent of the federal Speech or Debate Clause. See Ariz. Const. art. 4, \'a7 7 ("No member of the Legislature shall be liable in any civil or criminal prosecution for words spoken in debate."). This would make the provision nonsense for it would then have no effective application to legislators at all. n3
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n2 This Court generally defers to interpretations of state law made by the courts of appeals. See Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U.S. 474, 482 (1988); Pembauer v. City of Cincinnati, 475 U.S. 469, 484 n.13 (1986). This is especially true where, as here, the district court and the court of appeals agree on the proper interpretation of state law. See Bishop v. Wood, 426 U.S. 341, 346 (1976) ("this Court has accepted an interpretation of state law in which the District Court and Court of Appeals have concurred even if an examination of the state-law issue without such guidance might have justified a different conclusion").
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  \b \i0 \ul0 [*13]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n3 See United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U.S. 30, 36 (1992) ("a statute must, if possible, be construed in such a fashion that every word has some operative effect") (citations omitted).
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Thus, contrary to WLF's view, Article XXVIII limits non-English speech that is engaged in every day by legislators and their staff members with constituents concerning public policy and the daily workings of government. Article XXVIII furthermore presents a real and substantial chilling effect on speech by legislators to their constituents in the course of an election campaign, or that is arguably part of an election campaign. While amici recognize that one could argue that speech made in an election campaign is not covered by Article XXVIII because it is not "government business," such an argument assumes that a clear line can be drawn between "campaign" speech by a legislator and "non-campaign" speech. Of course, such line drawing is not possible. Most Members of Congress are constantly running for re-election, and are also constantly serving and communicating with their constituents. Such legislators should not be left to guess whether a given speech or constituent \b \i0 \ul0 [*14]\b0 \i0 \ul0   communication will be deemed "campaign" or "non-campaign" speech since most of what they do serves both purposes. n4 And yet, as illustrated below, many elected representatives could not serve either purpose effectively if they could not freely speak in languages other than English. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n4 Of course, because Article XXVIII applies only to government employees and officials, a private person running for office against an incumbent legislator would not be under the same restrictions in campaigning and could freely address the electorate in the language of his or her choice.
\par \fs20 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 B. The Recurring Non-English Communications Between Amici and Their Constituents Demonstrate the Harm Article XXVIII Would Cause to Legislators and to the Democratic Process\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 As legislators and elected officials, amici communicate every day with countless of their constituents. Many of amici's constituents do not speak English well or do not speak English at all. Consequently, many of these communications by amici and their staff members are in a language other than English. Indeed, some amici would find it impossible to fairly represent substantial portions of their constituencies at all if they were required \b \i0 \ul0 [*15]\b0 \i0 \ul0   to communicate only in English when performing government business.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Amici find it necessary to communicate, both orally and in writing, with their constituents in a variety of languages in order to consider proposed legislation and to conduct legislative fact finding; to provide information and services to constituents; and to inform the electorate for purposes of running for re-election. Many amici Members of Congress were formerly members of state legislative bodies, and their interactions with constituents in the United States Congress mirrors those in which they engaged as state legislators. Some examples of these non-English communications show both the breadth of these communications and their importance to amici's ability to represent their constituents.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a CHC member who previously served in both houses of the Florida legislature, currently represents the 18th District in Florida, which includes part of the Miami area. Her experience in a district where 26.6 percent of the population is not proficient in English n5 provides a good example of the range of a legislator's communications that could be chilled or prohibited by a provision like \b \i0 \ul0 [*16]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Article XXVIII. First, Spanish is the primary language of many of the community meetings Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen attends to inform her constituents about her activities in Congress and to gain information from them necessary to represent their views. Second, Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen relies heavily on Spanish language media to communicate her views to her constituents. Finally, every day the staff members in the Congresswoman's district office speak Spanish with constituents who are not proficient in English. A substantial mount of this work relates to providing information about visa and citizenship issues -- information which many constituents of the 18th District would simply do without if the Congresswoman's staff were prohibited from speaking Spanish.

If Congressman Underwood were prohibited from communicating with his constituents in Chamorro, he would be unable to discuss his activities in Congress with large portions of his constituency. Congressman Underwood also relies on the use of both Chamorro and Tagalog in campaigning for re-election.

The Congressman communicated the findings of the forum in Spanish to the Spanish language media and to non-English speaking constituents who had expressed fear for their safety.

And, as next shown, if they all were arbitrarily prohibited by a provision like Article XXVIII, the First Amendment rights of legislators plainly would be violated.
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 C. Article XXVIII Prohibits Speech By Legislators That is At the Core of Speech Protected by the First Amendment\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The First Amendment's guarantee of uninhibited discussion on public issues n16 is nowhere more important than where that discussion is between legislators and those they are elected to serve. In fact, speech between \b \i0 \ul0 [*23]\b0 \i0 \ul0   elected representatives and those they represent is central to our democracy. See, e.g., Doe v. McMillan, 412 U.S. 306, 328 (1973) (Douglas, J., concurring) ("A legislator's function in informing the public concerning matters before Congress or concerning the administration of Government is essential to maintaining our representative democracy."); The Federalist No. 56, at 346 (James Madison) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961) ("It is a sound and important principle that the representative ought to be acquainted with the interests and circumstances of his constituents."). Indeed, like the statute at issue in Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm. v. Federal Election Comm'n, 64 U.S.L.W. 4663 (1996), the difficulty posed by Article XXVIII is "its stifling effect on the ability of [an elected representative] to do what [he] exists to do," namely, represent his constituents.  Id. at 4670 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment and dissenting in part). 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n16 It is well settled that the "First and Fourteenth Amendments embody our 'profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open.'" Garrison v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 64, 74-75 (1964) (quoting New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 279 (1964)).

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Although this Court has never addressed the constitutionality of a provision like Article XXVIII, it has often considered the First Amendment protections afforded to speech by legislators and elected officials. A review of those precedents makes clear that Article XXVIII is unconstitutional.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In Bond v. Floyd, supra, this Court considered the First Amendment rights of state elected officials, and held that the Georgia legislature could not prevent Julian Bond from taking his seat as a member of the Georgia legislature based on political statements he had made. The Court held that "the manifest function of the First Amendment in a representative government requires that legislators be given the widest latitude to express their views on issues of policy." 385 U.S. at 135-36. The Court rejected Georgia's argument that although a private individual could not be prohibited from making such statements, the state could demand a higher standard from its elected officials.  Id. at 132-33. Such a requirement was unacceptable, the Court held, because the state had "no interest in limiting its legislators' capacity to discuss their views of local or national \b \i0 \ul0 [*25]\b0 \i0 \ul0   policy." Id. at 135 (footnote omitted). Article XXVIII would effectively impose such a limitation here.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Indeed, Petitioners do not dispute the Ninth Circuit's conclusion that Article XXVIII's sweeping prohibitions on non-English speech would most certainly violate the First Amendment if applied to ordinary citizens. See Yniguez, 69 F.3d at 937 ("A state cannot simply prohibit all persons within its borders from speaking in the tongue of their choice."); see also Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 401 (1923) ("perhaps it would be highly advantageous if all had ready understanding of our ordinary [English] speech, but this cannot be coerced by methods which conflict with the Constitution"). Under Bond, a higher standard may not be applied to elected representatives. If it could, as this brief shows, those representatives could not do the job they were elected to do.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 While the limitations on a legislator's day-to-day communications with his or her constituents is enough to invalidate a provision like Article XXVIII, as earlier noted this provision is unconstitutional for another reason: it prohibits communications by elected officials concerning \b \i0 \ul0 [*26]\b0 \i0 \ul0   elections, either their own re-election or the election of others. This Court has repeatedly recognized that communications in the course of an election are central to our democracy. See Brown v. Hartlage, 456 U.S. 45, 53 (1982) (per curiam) ("The free exchange of ideas provides special vitality to the process traditionally at the heart of American constitutional democracy -- the political campaign."). As the Court noted in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 52-53 (1976) (per curiam), "it is of particular importance that candidates have the unfettered opportunity to make their views known so that the electorate may intelligently evaluate the candidates' personal qualities and their positions on vital public issues before choosing among them on election day." n17 Obviously, a legislator cannot speak "intelligently" to the electorate if he or she is forced to speak in a language that particular electorate does not understand.

San Francisco Democratic Comm., 489 U.S. 214, 223 (1989) ("Indeed, the First Amendment 'has its fullest and most urgent application' to speech uttered during a campaign for political office.")

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Furthermore, Petitioners have plainly presented no compelling governmental interest that supports the limitation Article XXVIII places on core political speech. n18 In fact, as Bond holds, 385 U.S. at 135, the state has "no interest" at all in limiting legislators' very capacity to speak with their constituents. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n18 This Court's cases are clear that provisions like Article XXVIII that seek to limit speech in the course of an election campaign are subject to strict scrutiny under the First Amendment. See Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm., 64 U.S.L.W. at 4666 (plurality opinion); Brown v. Hartlage, 456 U.S. at 53-54 ("When a state seeks to restrict directly the offer of ideas by a candidate to the voters, the First Amendment surely requires that the restriction be demonstrably supported by not only a legitimate state interest, but a compelling one, and that the restriction operate without unnecessarily circumscribing protected expression."); First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 777 & n. 11 (1978); Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. at 44-45.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Nevertheless, Petitioners assert that Article XXVIII \b \i0 \ul0 [*28]\b0 \i0 \ul0   promotes the governmental interest in encouraging all citizens to learn English. Pet. Brief at 17-18. Amici support that interest. But they emphatically deny that that interest may be achieved by cutting off the First Amendment rights of legislators or cutting out a substantial part of the citizenry from participating in government. Such means are neither legitimate, nor narrowly tailored. Indeed, amici's own experience shows that the best way to bring non-English-speakers into the "mainstream" is to involve them in the democratic process while they learn English, not shut them out of it until they are fluent. As this Court recently noted, "the First Amendment directs us to be especially skeptical of regulations that seek to keep people in the dark for what the government perceives to be their own good." 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 116 S. Ct. 1495, 1508 (1996); see Anderson v. Celebreeze, 460 U.S. 780, 798 (1983) ("[a] State's claim that it is enhancing the ability of its citizenry to make wise decisions by restricting the flow of information to them must be viewed with some skepticism").
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Petitioners also argue that the state has a "substantial"  \b \i0 \ul0 [*29]\b0 \i0 \ul0   interest in promoting "national unity." Pet. Brief at 36-37. But the case Petitioners cite in support of this interest held that "promoting national unity" did not provide a compelling state interest for criminalizing speech with which the state disagreed. See Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 418 (1989). In fact, when the sentence quoted by Petitioners is read in context, it becomes clear that the true issue in Johnson, as well as in this case, is the means employed by the state in reaching its goal of national unity.  491 U.S. at 418 ("National unity as an end which officials may foster by persuasion and example is not in question. The problem is whether under our Constitution compulsion as here employed is a permissible means for its achievement.") (emphasis added) (quoting Board of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 640 (1943)); see Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. at 401.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Amici agree that encouraging citizens to speak English is a good thing; they also agree that encouraging "national unity" can be a good thing. But the means chosen by Arizona to promote these goals unnecessarily and unconstitutionally limit core First Amendment rights \b \i0 \ul0 [*30]\b0 \i0 \ul0   of legislators to serve and communicate with their constituents.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Amici also agree with Petitioner's amici WLF that "politics requires deliberation, and deliberation requires that those deliberating understand each other." WLF Brief at 23. But from this statement, WLF and Petitioners draw the wrong conclusion. A legislator who is required to speak only in English will simply not be understood by that portion of his or her constituency that does not speak English. Amici likewise agree with WLF that "in a democracy, where the people are sovereign, and government is not the preserve of a favored few, but the purview and responsibility of the people as a whole . . . the people as a whole must be able to deliberate amongst themselves, and to deliberate, they must be able to communicate." Id. (emphasis added). But a provision like Article XXVIII that prevents legislators from speaking languages other than English with their constituents ensures that the people as a whole will be unable to communicate with their elected officials and therefore will be unable to participate in the political process in the most direct way possible.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Finally, amici agree with WLF that "for this nation to work,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*31]\b0 \i0 \ul0   we must all be able to discuss our political heritage, the foundations of our rights, the nature of our duties, together." Id. at 26 (emphasis added). This discussion is impossible, however, if those who do not speak English are unable to participate in the debate. The First and Fourteenth Amendments preserve the right of all people in our Nation, including those who do not speak English, to be able to participate fully in discussions with their representatives on matters of public policy, and preserve the rights of legislators to freely discuss with all of their constituents the matters necessary to effectively represent those constituents in Congress and in the state legislatures. Because a provision such as Article XXVIII violates these rights, it cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny and should be invalidated by this Court.
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 II. THE LONG TRADITION OF NON-ENGLISH COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN LEGISLATORS AND THEIR CONSTITUENTS CONFIRMS THE UNCONSTITUTIONALITY OF ARTICLE XXVIII\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Although amici's experience demonstrates the critical importance of legislators' ability to communicate freely with all their constituents -- even those who do not speak English -- amici's experience \b \i0 \ul0 [*32]\b0 \i0 \ul0   is nothing new; government representatives have used languages other than English to communicate with their constituents since the very founding of our nation. This tradition of non-English communications by legislators provides the historical backdrop for the adoption of both the First and the Fourteenth Amendments, and shows that it was well understood by the legislators of these times that the practice of non-English communications by legislators was both necessary and appropriate to keep all the people informed about the workings of the government. n19
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n19 In giving meaning to the terms of the First Amendment, this Court frequently informs its decisions with reference to the history of our nation at the time that the Constitution was adopted. See Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court, 478 U.S. 1, 10 (1986) (First Amendment right of access to preliminary hearings informed by "tradition of accessibility"); Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court, 464 U.S. 501, 508 (1984) (First Amendment right of access to voir dire supported by fact that "public jury selection . . . was the common practice in America when the Constitution was adopted."); Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court, 456 U.S. 596, 604-05 (1982). As Justice Scalia recently noted, historical evidence from the states at the time the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted is also important to the application of First Amendment principles to state laws. See 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 116 S. Ct. at 1515 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (relevant evidence provided by "the state legislative practices prevalent at the time the First Amendment was adopted . . . . [and] more relevant still are the state legislative practices at the time the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, since it is most improbable that that adoption was meant to overturn any existing national consensus regarding free speech.").

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 These historical materials also believe the conclusory arguments by Petitioners and Petitioners' amici WLF that the essence of our democracy relies upon prohibiting the use of languages other than English. See Pet. Brief at 36-38. Instead, the long-standing and continuing tradition of our nation is to permit legislators to communicate in languages other than English with portions of their constituencies that do not understand English. This tradition confirms and underscores amici's own experience that it is only through such communications, which are given the greatest First Amendment protection, that amici and other legislators may successfully represent all of their constituents in our democratic process.

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 More importantly, not only did the Founders of the new nation fail to announce an official language, or to prohibit the speaking of languages other than English, they also rejected attempts to regulate "official" American English. In the 1780s, an effort to establish a national language academy to standardize American English failed, demonstrating the Founders' awareness of the lingual diversity of the new nation, and \b \i0 \ul0 [*39]\b0 \i0 \ul0   unwillingness to prohibit expression based on the language in which it occurred. n32

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 None of this is to say that some form of an "official English" provision might not be debatable today. But it is to say that at the time of the First and Fourteenth Amendments' adoptions, the Framers of those Amendments certainly did not contemplate that they -- or any other legislator -- could be precluded from speaking whatever language they chose with those they represented.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Not only was communication by the government in languages other than English accepted at the time the First and Fourteenth Amendments were adopted, but our country also has a long history of lawmakers, public officials, and candidates using languages other than English to address non-English speaking voters in their native language in order to gain their votes and ensure communication between the government and all of its constituents. n33 For example, in Virginia, German-speaking candidates for public office were routinely successful against non-German \b \i0 \ul0 [*40]\b0 \i0 \ul0   speakers in portions of the state just after the Revolutionary War. n34 Well into the nineteenth century, non-German speaking politicians throughout Virginia recognized the disadvantages they faced, and turned to German speaking allies or used handbills printed in German to further their campaigns. n35

One such man was Carl Schurz who campaigned in both German and English in the 1856 Presidential campaign for John Freemont, n36 and in Abraham Lincoln's 1858 United States Senate campaign against Stephen A. Douglas. n37 In the 1860 Presidential race, Schurz again campaigned for Lincoln, addressing meetings of German-born voters in German in a number of states. n38 Schurz himself was elected to the United States Senate from Missouri in 1869, becoming the first German-born citizen elected to that body. n39

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Again this history is important not because it commands us today to continue the tradition of permitting discourse by public officials in whatever language they choose. Rather, that history is important because (1) it refutes Petitioners' unsupported contention that our democracy can \b \i0 \ul0 [*43]\b0 \i0 \ul0   work only if we exclude non-English speakers from it; and (2) it demonstrates that Petitioners' conception of the First Amendment -- that it would permit suppression of non-English speech by legislators -- was foreign to those who wrote that Amendment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In summary, this Court's cases, the country's history, and amici's experience all confirm a fundamental proposition: the First Amendment and our democratic process cannot function if legislators are prohibited from communicating with certain of their constituents. Article XXVIII should therefore be deemed unconstitutional.
