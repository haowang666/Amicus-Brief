\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Since its inception in 1972, the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, Inc., (PRLDEF) has worked to protect the civil and political rights of the Puerto Rican and Latino communities. PRLDEF has represented Latinos in numerous cases throughout the country seeking to protect and further their rights in the areas of voting, education and language rights. See, eg.  Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352 (1991). The issue presented in this case, whether English may be established as an official language, is of critical importance to the Latino community and this organization because such a policy would, if upheld, deny Latinos the ability to fully and equally participate in American society.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium is a not-for-profit, nonpartisan organization whose mission is to advance the legal and civil rights of Asian Pacific Americans through a national collaborative structure that pursues litigation, advocacy, public education and public policy development. The Consortium is interested in the present case because it believes that Article 28 places linguistic barriers on the full social and political participation of Asian Pacific Americans.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Legal Aid Society of San Francisco, Employment Law Center (ELC), a project of the Legal Aid Society of San Francisco, is a private, non-profit, public interest law firm that has litigated issues relating to employment discrimination and other workplace rules for over twenty years. Through its work, ELC has challenged laws that impact upon communities of color and recent immigrants to the United States, including cases in which the rights of non-English speakers have come under challenge. See, e.g., Garcia v. Spun Steak Co., 998 F.2d 1480 (9th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 114 S.Ct. 2726, 129 L.Ed.2d 849 (1994). ELC has appeared as amicus in the parallel Arizona state court challenge to Article 28. Ruiz v. Arizona, (Arizona Court of Appeals No. 1 CA-CV 94-235).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Asian Pacific American Labor Alliance, AFL-CIO (APALA), is a non-profit labor organization founded in 1992 to defend and advocate for the civil and human rights of the Asian Pacific American community and provide a vehicle within our society for the concerns of Asian Pacific American Workers. APALA's membership includes many immigrant workers for whom English is a second language. APALA is interested in the present case because Article 28 and laws like it infringe on the rights of its members.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF) is a civil rights organization that addresses critical issues facing Asian Pacific Americans through community education, advocacy and litigation. Program priorities include the elimination of anti-Asian violence, advancement of immigrant rights, employment and labor rights, and redress for Japanese American World War II internees. AALDEF has an interest in opposing Article 28 because we believe that it violates the civil and political rights of Asian Pacific Americans in contravention of the work of this organization.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Asian Law Caucus, Inc,. (ALC) is a not-for-profit, public interest legal organization whose mission is to promote, advance and represent the civil rights of Asian and Pacific Islander (API) communities. Since the majority of APIs are foreign-born, ALC's first priority is working to overcome language barriers to facilitate the full political participation of all members of society. ALC believes that Article 28 punitively singles out limited English proficient Arizonans by denying them access to basic services and the opportunity to fully participate in society.

Programs focus on immigration, language rights and civil rights amongst other issues. APALC opposes Article 28 because it unduly burdens the rights of Asians and Pacific Islanders.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Community Service Society of New York (CSS) can trace its history of serving the poor back 150 years. Throughout this time CSS has provided direct services to the poor and immigrant communities of New York and has been a voice in promoting policies that enable these communities to escape poverty. CSS promotes the respect and development of various languages and the simple notion that the government must be able to respond to the needs of its constituents in languages they can understand. To that end CSS has testified before legislative bodies on language policy issues and therefore, has an interest in the proceedings herein.

The HNBA has been the principal force behind the increased representation of Hispanics in all sectors of the legal profession and has served as a legal voice for Hispanics for over twenty years. The HNBA is dedicated to serving as the national voice for the concerns and opinions of Hispanics in the legal profession. Since Article 28 of the Arizona Constitution negatively impacts Hispanics, the present case is very important to the HNBA.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Language Rights Coalition is a coalition of individuals and organizations dedicated to fighting all legislation that infringes on the linguistic integrity and civil rights of language minorities in the nation. The Coalition believes that Article 28, by imposing an official language on the population of Arizona, prevents the full participation of language minorities in the State's political life in contravention of the goals of the Coalition.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 STATEMENT OF CASE\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Article 28 was adopted by a slim majority of Arizona's voters in a 1988 ballot initiative known as Proposition 106. Article 28 makes English the official language of the "ballot, the public schools and all government functions and actions." Art. 28 \'a7 1.(1)(2). It applies to "the legislative, executive and judicial branches of government...all political subdivisions, departments, agencies, organizations and instrumentalities of [the] state including local governments and municipalities." Art. 28 \'a7 1.(3)(a)(ii).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The measure not only regulates the language of state government, but also forecloses the passage of ameliorative legislation by local governments: "No entity to which this Article applies shall make or enforce a law, order, decree or policy which requires the use of languages other than English." Art. 28 \'a7 3.(1)(b).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The scope and application of Article 28 \b \i0 \ul0 [*6]\b0 \i0 \ul0   is extraordinarily broad encompassing every local and state employee from the neighborhood school teacher and the local justice of the peace to elected leaders of small towns and large cities. If allowed to stand, Article 28 would make its weight felt in every corner of Arizona; neither the intimate conversations between nurses and their patients nor the rhetorical pronouncements of elected leaders would be spared the chilling effect of its reach.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The limits of Article 28 are neither known nor are apparent from its language. It broadly requires that every level and branch of government, including every entity and person, "act in English and no other language." Art. 28 \'a7 3.(1)(a) (emphasis added). As the Court below found, it would prohibit a rabbi, who received his license from the State, from saying "mazel tov" at a wedding.  Yniguez v. Arizonans for Official English, 69 F.3d. 920, 932 (9th Cir. 1995). If it withstands constitutional scrutiny, Article 28 would prohibit a school teacher from explaining to parents who did not understand English how their children are faring in school and would prohibit a State judge from using Latin in her decisions. Ironically, it would \b \i0 \ul0 [*7]\b0 \i0 \ul0   also prohibit the State from printing the phrase E Pluribus Unum used by the proponents of Proposition 106 in the Arizona Publicity Pamphlet, an official State document accompanying the Proposition. J.A. 29. Tragically, it would also prohibit locally funded adult classes to learn English where the native languages of the pupils would be used.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 One of the most pernicious features of Article 28 is that it gives any "person who resides or does business in [the] State" the right to sue to enforce its provisions. Art. 28 \'a7 4. A doctor, nurse or teacher trying, in good faith to provide comprehensible information to the public could successfully be sued for the "offense" of speaking a language other than English. This extreme scenario certainly cannot be ruled out given the strong positions taken by the proponents of Proposition 106; U.S. English called for the end to all multilingual services that were not "essential" and other proponents equated patriotism with speaking English. J.A. 31-32.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Although Article 28 purports to govern the speech and acts of state and local employees, it is clear that its true target is the racial and ethnic language minorities of Arizona. The provision \b \i0 \ul0 [*8]\b0 \i0 \ul0   was publicized as a way to encourage "non-English speakers to learn English." J.A. 29. The constitutional amendment was intended to send a "clear and simple message - English is the official language of Arizona. To function and participate in our society, every resident must know English." J.A. 26.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 It is also clear who it is that comprises Arizona's non-English speaking population - ethnic and racial language minorities. Out of Arizona's total population of 3.67 million, over 3.37 million speak English. n1 Over 8% of this population is considered limited English proficient because they do not speak English "very well." n2 Of this 8%, 64% are Latinos n3, 6% are Asian Pacific Islanders; and 20% are Native Americans. n4

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 It is no coincidence that Article 28 impacts so heavily, almost exclusively, in fact, on racial and ethnic language minorities. Article 28 was not passed in a vacuum but at a time of increased national immigration that has caused anxiety amongst older, more established communities. Immigrants today, mostly Asians and Latinos, are viewed with the same kind of distrust and subjected to the same kind of restrictive laws as were immigrants in years past. n5 In fact, there are documented connections between proponents of official English legislation and anti-immigrant groups. n6

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The crucial link between national origin and language usage is the "Achilles heel" of language minorities and was exploited by the proponents of Article 28 in order to achieve the disenfranchisement of newcomers. Like anti-immigrant advocates of the past, proponents of Article 28 specifically harkened Arizona's voters back to some utopian time when immigrants came to America and quickly learned English and contrasted that vision with their conception of the present. J.A. 26. n7
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n7 The proponents' vision of the past was clearly distorted. Each new wave of immigration brings up rosy-eyed versions of the past. For example, the Federal Immigration Commission issued a report in 1911 contrasting the then "old" and "new" immigrants. The report argued that the "old" immigrants had quickly mingled with native-born Americans and became assimilated, while "new" immigrants from Italy, Russia, Hungary and other countries were less intelligent, less willing to learn English, were not assimilating, and were criminally inclined. Leibowicz, Joseph, The Proposed English Language Amendment: Shield or Sword? 3 YALE LAW & POL'Y REV. 519, 536-537 (1985).
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Proponents of the Proposition saw speaking \b \i0 \ul0 [*11]\b0 \i0 \ul0   any language other than English as signs of "ethnic separatism" and "ethnic distrust." J.A. 26; J.A. 31. It was these "ethnics" that had to be forced into conformity in order to preserve national unity. The Article punishes these citizens for not knowing English and prohibits bilingual government employees from using their language skills to assist these same ethnics.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Amici respectfully urge this Court to review the First Amendment constitutionality of Article 28 with heightened scrutiny because its purpose and effect is to adversely impact racial and ethnic language minorities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In reviewing the constitutionality of state regulations of speech, Courts have regularly examined the statute in a comprehensive manner that entails consideration of the context in which the law was created as well as its operation and effect. Despite the facial neutrality of laws, if the effect of a regulation falls most heavily on "disfavored" groups, then the state restriction is reviewed under heightened scrutiny.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Further, laws that create a structural barrier to the exercise of the political rights of minorities are also reviewed with greater suspicion. While governments \b \i0 \ul0 [*12]\b0 \i0 \ul0   may place restrictions on the public's access to the political process, if a state regulation uniquely burdens minorities, then Courts will look beyond the facial neutrality of the law and hold government to a high standard of justification.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In the present case, racial and ethnic language minorities, members of a disfavored group, are almost exclusively the victims of Article 28. This disparate negative impact is no coincidence. Instead, by exploiting the link between national origin and language usage, proponents of Article 28 intended to specifically burden racial and ethnic language minorities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Indeed, Article 28 is part of an unfortunate national history of using content-neutral laws to attempt to marginalize language minorities. In reviewing these laws, this Court was cognizant of the context in which they were passed and on whom the burdens of the laws would fall; the Court often brushed a veil of neutrality aside to expose the coercive agendas of these laws and strike them down as unconstitutional.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Article 28's disparate and purposeful impact on racial and ethnic language minorities and the traditional use of this type of law to alienate and punish minorities all coalesce \b \i0 \ul0 [*13]\b0 \i0 \ul0   to require this Court to apply a heightened scrutiny standard when it conducts its First Amendment review of this law. Amici believe that Article 28 will not survive such a review.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 THIS COURT MUST REVIEW THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF ARTICLE 28 WITH HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY BECAUSE OF ITS ALMOST EXCLUSIVE IMPACT ON RACIAL AND ETHNIC LANGUAGE MINORITIES\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Introduction
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Respondents and other amici have ably demonstrated that Article 28 should be struck down because it violates the First Amendment rights of governmental employees and others. Amici fully agree and support their analysis. However, we write separately to assist the Court in understanding the discriminatory purpose of Article 28 and its impact on racial and ethnic language minorities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The proponents of Article 28 campaigned for the provision as a measure to bar governmental employees from writing or speaking in any language other than English. While the law was ostensibly aimed at state and local employees, its purpose and effect was to punish non-English speakers as a means to coerce them to learn English. The law is not benign. Article 28 makes it impossible for non-English speakers making \b \i0 \ul0 [*14]\b0 \i0 \ul0   it impossible for them to communicate with their government and isolating them from the political discourse and the political process generally.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Because racial and ethnic language minorities, primarily Latinos, Asians and Native Americans, are almost the only ones impacted by the law, this Court must use heightened scrutiny in its First Amendment analysis of Article 28.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Amici submit that Article 28 cannot withstand that scrutiny.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 A. This Court Must Review Article 28 Under Heightened Scrutiny
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Although the First Amendment is most often used to protect the content of speech, or a viewpoint, it also protects speech from the "operation and effect" of statutes which, while facially neutral, have a disparate impact on disfavored groups. See, Near v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson, 283 U.S. 697, 708 (1931). Indeed, "naked restrictions on the dissemination of ideas," Martin v. Struthers, 319 U.S. 141, 147 (1949), can be achieved with content-neutral laws as easily as with those consciously attempting to restrict a particular viewpoint. Id.

\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0 Common sense drives the point home: however neutral the government's intentions in enacting a law, the operation of that \b \i0 \ul0 [*15]\b0 \i0 \ul0   law may have a vastly uneven impact. There is no equality in a law prohibiting both rich and poor from sleeping under the bridges of Paris; there is no equality in law prohibiting anonymous pamhleteering by both popular and unpopular groups, see, Talley v. California, 362 U.S. 60, (1960).

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Despite the facial neutrality of a law, if its impact falls most heavily on disadvantaged or unpopular groups, courts must view the law with greater suspicion and hold the government to a high standard of justification.

\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0 The speech of unpopular groups, of course, often meets with hostility and repression, though it is more commonly the message that is targeted than the language in which it is communicated. Given the link between unpopular speech and unpopular groups, it is not surprising that even some of our most venerable First Amendment precedents have an (albeit implicit) equal protection component.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 For instance, in City of Richmond, the NAACP brought an action \b \i0 \ul0 [*16]\b0 \i0 \ul0   challenging the constitutionality of Richmond's parade ordinance that required 20 days advance notice before a parade or demonstration could be held. The civil rights organization wanted to hold a timely march after the City decided not to investigate the suspicious death of a black man in the custody of police.  Id. at 1349.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Ninth Circuit found that the effectiveness of a demonstration to a large extent depend upon the it timing and forum.  Id. at 1356. The unreasonably long advance notice requirement, it reasoned, effectively denied organizations like the NAACP the ability to hold spontaneous demonstrations and marches in response to perceived injustices.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 After concluding that the parade ordinance was facially content neutral, the Court found that the cities must "go a great distance" in order to justify its law because it fell most heavily on a "disfavored" group who was more likely to need to demonstrate on short notice.  Id. at 1356. See also, Asian American Business Group v. City of Pomona, 716 F. Supp. 1328 (C.D.Cal 1989)
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In the present case, it is the ability of Latinos, Asians and Native Americans, the largest language \b \i0 \ul0 [*17]\b0 \i0 \ul0   minority groups in Arizona, to communicate with their government that is being suppressed. It is their First Amendment right to "give and receive information" that is at stake.  Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, 425 U.S. 748, 757 (1976). See also, Board of Educ., Island Trees Union Free School District No. 26 v. Pico, 457 U.S. 853, 866-68 (1982); Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390 (1923)(where law struck down partly because it interfered with students' right to acquire knowledge); Bartels v. Iowa, 262 U.S. 404 (1923).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 As the Court below found, by banning the use of "entire vocabularies" in governmental speech, Article 28 "bars or significantly interferes with the ability of the non-English speaking populace of Arizona to 'receive information and ideas.'" Yniguez, 69 F.3d at 935, 941, citing to, Virginia Citizens, supra. Indeed, Article 28 strikes at the heart of the "natural right of the members of an organized society, united for their common good to impart and acquire information about their common interests," which is the heart of the First Amendment. Grosjean v. American Press Co, 297 U.S. 233, 243 (1935). \b \i0 \ul0 [*18]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 It is the disparate impact of this denial of First Amendment rights on such distinct, relatively small and marginalized groups n8, however, that the lower Court here found so deplorable: 
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0 We note that the adverse impact of Article 28's overbreadth is especially egregious because it is not uniformally spread over the population but falls almost entirely upon Hispanics and other national origin minorities.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  Yniguez, 69 F.3d at 947 (cites omitted). Not only are language minorities most heavily impacted by Article 28, but the whole purpose of the law was to impact on this group. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n8 Those who speak a language other than English in America, primarily Latinos, Asians, and Native Americans, are members of ethnic groups that bear the insignia of being "discrete and insular" minorities; they are readily identifiable and saddled with a history of exclusion from American society which makes legislation that adversely impacts their rights particularly suspect. See, U.S. v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U.S. 144, 152, n.4 (1938); San Antonio School District v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 28 (1973); Regents of Univ. of California v.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Like the parade ordinance in Richmond, Article 28 is facially neutral. However, the Richmond Court did not end its analysis there. Instead, it examined the impact of the law, recognized its adverse effect on disfavored groups and used the knowledge of that effect to hold the city to a high standard of justification.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Similarly, this Court must cut through the veil of Article 28's neutrality, recognize that it impacts virtually only on language minorities and treat the law as what it really is -- a purposeful attempt to disenfranchise language minorities by eliminating their ability to communicate with their government.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 B. The Purpose and Effect of Article 28 is to Punish Racial and Ethnic Language Minorities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 1. Non-English speakers are overwhelmingly of foreign national origin or are ethnic minorities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Arizona's foreign-born population, racial and ethnic minorities, are the true target of Article 28. It is evident from the campaign literature for Proposition 106, that the link between foreign national origin and English language proficiency was used by the proponents of Article 28 in their appeal to Arizona's voters. Not only did its proponents argue for the need for new \b \i0 \ul0 [*20]\b0 \i0 \ul0   citizens to learn English but they also argued that: 
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0 The state of Arizona is at a crossroads. It can move towards the fears and tensions of language rivalries and ethnic distrust, or it can reverse this trend and strengthen our common bond, the English language.
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 J.A. 26 This race-based forecast of conflict with language minority communities attributed to non-English speakers the propensity to destroy Arizona's social fabric. By linking language and ethnicity in the same breath and characterizing language minorities as a social threat, Article 28's proponents belied their own claims of benign motivation. This intentional impact on ethnic and racial minorities confirms the concern this Court expressed in Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352 (1991): 
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0 It may well be, for certain ethnic groups and in some communities, that proficiency in a particular language, like skin color, should be treated as a surrogate for race under an equal protection analysis.
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Hernandez at 412-3 (emphasis added). The Hernandez Court recognized the obvious -- the connection between language usage and certain racial and ethnic groups. See Yu Cong Eng v. Trinidad, 271 U.S. 500, 528 (1926) \b \i0 \ul0 [*21]\b0 \i0 \ul0   (equal protection denied to Chinese merchants who kept records in their native tongue); see also, Hernandez v. Texas, 347 U.S. 475, 480 n.12 (1954) (Spanish surnames "provide ready identification of the members of this [Mexican-American] class") and Castaneda v.

Nichols, 414 U.S. 563, 568-9 (1974) (non-English speaking Chinese students subjected to national origin discrimination in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964). n9

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 2. Courts have closely examined the purpose and effect of facially neutral language restrictions.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Article 28 is another chapter in our nation's sad history of using language restrictions to punish and alienate ethnic and racial language minorities. n10 All too often, whenever language minorities have become unpopular, attempts have been made to marginalize them by exploiting their need to communicate in languages other than English. These attempts usually took the form of facially neutral laws that prohibited the use of any language other than English, not just the language of the disfavored group. This Court, however, regularly saw through this facial neutrality and examined the laws within the context in which they were created and whom they effected. This Court should continue this tradition today. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n10 Restrictive language policies were first used against Native Americans. The Federal government, in the late 1870's, attempted to "civilize" Native Americans and acclimate these nomadic people to reservation life. The government instituted policies ending bilingual education programs in reservation schools and forcibly removed Native American children from their homes. The government also established "Indian boarding schools" for these children where their mouths would be washed out with soap for speaking in the "barbarous" dialects of their native tongues. See, Crawford, James, BILINGUAL EDUCATION: HISTORY, THEORY, POLITICS AND PRACTICE, 3rd ed. at 25-26 (Bilingual Education Services 1995). Congress recently found that past federal policy lead to "acts of suppression and extermination of Native American languages and cultures, Native American Languages Act, 25 U.S.C. \'a7 2809 (1990), that is only now being remedied.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 During World War I, anti-foreigner, and especially anti-German, sentiment crested, leading to the adoption of legislation in fourteen states prohibiting the teaching of modern foreign languages by fourteen states. n11 In Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390 (1923) this Court recognized that restrictions on non-English languages most often were simply attempts to discriminate against unpopular minorities. Commenting on Nebraska's law which made it unlawful to teach in non-English languages, the Court noted that the Nebraska Supreme Court found that the "law affects few citizens except those of foreign lineage." Id. at 398. The Court also recognized that:

\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0 The desire of the legislature to foster a homogeneous people with American ideals, prepared readily to understand current discussions of civic matters is easy to appreciate. Unfortunate experiences during the late war, and aversion to every characteristic of truculent adversaries, were certainly enough to quicken that aspiration. But the means adopted, we think, exceed the limitations upon the power of the state, and conflict with rights assured to plaintiff in error.

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In 1927, this Court was again called upon to review the constitutionality of legislation, which this time brought foreign language schools in Hawaii under such strict governmental regulation that the schools would be required to close.  Farrington v. Tokushige, 273 U.S. 284, 298 (1927). Although the legislation did not target any particular language for special restriction, the Court noted that over two-thirds of the schools taught Japanese and that over the previous twenty years the number of Japanese pupils in the public and private schools generally had increased exponentially.  Id. at 291. The asserted goals of the law was to "fully and effectively regulate the conducting of foreign language schools and the teaching of foreign languages, in order that the Americanism of the pupils be promoted."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In striking down the legislation as unconstitutional, the Court emphasized that,

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Similarly, in Yu Cong Eng v. Trinidad, 271 U.S. 500 (1926), the Court struck down a Philippine law that required business owners to keep their financial records in English, Spanish or other local dialects, which local Chinese merchants could not read or write. Of the 85,000 merchants in the Philippines to whom the bookkeeping law applied, only the 12,000 Chinese merchants could not comply.  Id. at 512. The Philippines justified the law based on their need to inspect the books of merchants to ensure that they were paying appropriate taxes.  Id. at 514. The Court found that the law was "obviously intended chiefly to affect [the Chinese] as distinguished from the rest of the community." Id. at 528. The Court also noted that public opinion can be easily swayed and the police power of a state or territory used to repress unpopular groups. "Happily for all", stated the Court, "the fundamental guaranties of the Constitution can not be freely submerged if and whenever some ostensible justification is advanced..." Id. at 527. \b \i0 \ul0 [*26]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In all of these cases, a fear or animus toward a particular group lead governments to develop restrictive legislation that attempted to achieve unity by prescribing orthodoxy. In each case, this Court found those restrictions to be in violation of this nation's general tradition of tolerance and its Constitution. See also, Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U.S. 97, 105 (1968) (where the language restriction in Meyer was described as designed to "promote civic cohesiveness by encouraging the learning of English".)
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 As Justice Jackson stated speaking for this Court: 
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb120 \fi360 National unity as an end which officials may foster by persuasion and example is not in question. The problem is whether under our Constitution compulsion as here employed is a permissible means for its achievement.
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb120 \fi360 Struggles to coerce conformity of sentiment in support of some end thought essential to their time and country have been waged by many good as well as evil men. Nationalism is a relatively recent phenomenon but at other times and places the ends have been racial or territorial security, support of a dynasty or regime, and particular plans for saving souls. As first and moderate methods to attain \b \i0 \ul0 [*27]\b0 \i0 \ul0   unity have failed, those bent on its accomplishment must resort to an ever increasing severity. ...Compulsory unification of opinion achieves only the unanimity of the graveyard.
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb120 \fi360 It seems trite to say that the First Amendment to our Constitution was designed to avoid these ends by avoiding these beginnings.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Article 28 was promoted as enabling the State to protect "democracy by encouraging 'unity and political stability'; encouraging a common language; and protecting public confidence". Regardless of the merits of these goals, by reviewing Article 28 under the strictest First Amendment scrutiny, this Court would be following its considerable and noble precedent which in the past has prevented sporadic, nativist sentiment from turning this country toward deprivations of liberty and equality and away from its spirit of tolerance and freedom.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 C. Article 28 Not Only Impacts On Racial and Ethnic Minorities but Creates a Structural Barrier to Their Exercise of Political Rights.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This Court should review Article 28 under heightened scrutiny not only because ethnic and racial minorities \b \i0 \ul0 [*28]\b0 \i0 \ul0   are being targeted but also because the nature of the harm leads to the political disempowerment of an entire group. Just as this Court has examined the operation and effect of content-neutral speech restrictions, this Court has also looked at the impact of facially neutral laws which effect access to the political process and used heightened scrutiny when the rights of minorities were disproportionately burdened.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Article 28 prohibits any public entity, including local and state legislatures from "making, or enforcing, law, order, decree or policy which requires the use of a language other than English." Article 28, \'a7 3.1. Like the initiative struck down in Romer v. Evans, 64 U.S.L.W. 4353 (U.S. May 20, 1996), Article 28 precludes language minorities from seeking remedial or beneficial legislation through the normal political process either at the state or local level. Unlike any other group, language minorities must attempt another constitutional amendment in order to undo the harmful effects of Article 28.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The imposition of such a disability on a discrete group, identifiable by a single trait is particularly heinous. As this Court stated in Romer: "[the] sheer \b \i0 \ul0 [*29]\b0 \i0 \ul0   breadth [of Amendment 2] is so discontinuous with the reasons offered for it that the amendment seems inexplicable by anything but animus toward the class that it affects," 64 U.S.L.W. at 4356.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Indeed this Court has often struck down laws where there was a particularly deleterious effect on the political rights of racial or ethnic minorities. For instance, in Hunter v. Erickson, 393 U.S. 385 (1964) this Court found that minorities' rights to equal access to the political process could not be unduly burdened. In that case, the City of Akron amended its charter to not only nullify a fair housing ordinance but to also make it more difficult to pass another ordinance like it. The Court found this simply impermissible. The Court stated: 
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0 The Akron charter obviously made it substantially more difficult to secure enactment of ordinances subject to [the amendment]....Moreover, although the law on its face treats Negro and white, Jew and gentile in an identical manner, the reality is that the law's impact falls on the minority.. [the amendment] places special burdens on racial minorities within the governmental process. This is no more permissible than \b \i0 \ul0 [*30]\b0 \i0 \ul0   denying them the vote, on an equal basis with others.
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  Id. at 390-91 (emphasis added). See also, Reitman v. Mulkey, 387 U.S. 369 (1967) (where this Court overturned a state constitutional amendment that sought to overturn legislation barring racial discrimination in housing. In doing so it undertook an analysis of the amendment "in terms of its 'immediate objective,' its 'ultimate effect' and its historical context and the conditions existing before its enactment.'" Id. at 373.)
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The same reasoning was used in Washington v. Seattle School District No. 1, 458 U.S. 457 (1982) to invalidate a state initiative that overturned local school district's desegregation plans. The Court stated that the Equal Protection Clause goes beyond simply guaranteeing voting rights to reach, "'political structure[s] that treat all individuals as equals'...yet more subtly distorts governmental processes in such a way as to place special burdens on the ability of minority groups to achieve beneficial legislation." Id. at 467 (cite omitted). Although governments may make it difficult generally for its citizens to enact laws or "allocate governmental \b \i0 \ul0 [*31]\b0 \i0 \ul0   power on the basis of any general principle," using "the racial nature of an issue" to determine the governmental decisionmaking structure, imposes "substantial and unique burdens on racial minorities." Id. at 470, citing to Hunter v. Erickson (Harlan, J. concurring).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Of special importance to the instant case as well is the Court's acknowledgement in Washington that although the initiative was facially neutral, there was "little doubt that the initiative was drawn for racial purposes." Id. at 471. The Court relied upon the fact that the initiative would have no effect except on districts with mandatory busing plans and the statements made by the proponents of the initiative.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Similarly, Article 28 would have an effect only on language minorities. Further, the proponents of Article 28 have made it abundantly clear that that effect was deliberate. As in Romer, the present case is a situation where a state is making a "class of persons a stranger to its laws." Romer 64 U.S.L.W. at 4357. There is no alternative way for language minorities to effectuate their political goals except by initiating another constitutional battle where their minority \b \i0 \ul0 [*32]\b0 \i0 \ul0   interests have little hope of being effectuated. By imposing the English language on its residents through constitutional provision, Arizona is not only setting up a procedural burden on the passage of beneficial legislation for language minorities but also places a structural burden on "minority participation in the political process.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Article 28 was passed in Arizona amidst a growing national furor against immigrants from Mexico, Latin America and Asia. The proponents of the measure boldly exploited these sentiments by creating a spectre of ethnic disunity if Proposition 106 was not passed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Although the law is ostensibly aimed at the speech of state and local employees, it is clearly the non-English speaking populace of Arizona that was its true target and who will be most harmed by the implementation of the law. By telling non-English speaking citizens that they must communicate with government only in English, Article 28 subjects these citizens to virtually complete social and political isolation. Unfortunately, these kinds of attempts to compel uniformity have been made in the past against whatever group was currently disfavored.  \b \i0 \ul0 [*33]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This Court has often intervened on behalf of the minority and saved the honor of our Constitution from the vagaries of tyrannical majorities. In the present case, this Court is called upon to do the same. Following the wisdom displayed in cases from Meyer to Romer, this Court must look beyond the apparent neutrality of Article 28 to consider its true agenda and its impact on racial and ethnic language minorities. Once it does, amici are confident that this Court will find that Article 28 violates the First Amendment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 For all of the foregoing reasons, amici respectfully request that this Court affirm the Ninth Circuit's decision.
