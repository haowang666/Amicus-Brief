\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  \b \i0 \ul0 [*4]\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b \i0 \ul0 SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In \b0 \i \ul0 Thornburg v. Gingles,\b0 \i0 \ul0  478 U.S. 30 (1986), this Court identified three "preconditions" to a vote dilution claim under \'a7 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 79 Stat. 437, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \'a7 1973. The first \b0 \i \ul0 Gingles\b0 \i0 \ul0  precondition is that the relevant minority group be "sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district." 478 U.S. at 50. It is well settled that \'a7 2 plaintiffs can satisfy this precondition by demonstrating that it is possible to draw a reasonably compact single-member district in which minority voters are a simple numerical majority of the population of eligible voters. The issue in this \b \i0 \ul0 [**6]\b0 \i0 \ul0   case is whether plaintiffs can satisfy the first \b0 \i \ul0 Gingles\b0 \i0 \ul0  precondition where they cannot meet this numerical majority test.
\par \b0 \i \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Amici\b0 \i0 \ul0  believe the answer to this question is yes. Plaintiffs should also be able to satisfy the first \b0 \i \ul0 Gingles\b0 \i0 \ul0  precondition by showing that it is possible to draw a reasonably compact single-member district in which minority voters--although not a numerical majority--nonetheless have a realistic potential to elect candidates of their choice. To prove their potential to elect candidates in such a district, \'a7 2 plaintiffs should be required to demonstrate a predictable level of white crossover voting sufficient to enable minority-preferred candidates to win elections. In these circumstances, minority voters should be deemed a \b0 \i \ul0 functional\b0 \i0 \ul0  majority of the proposed district's population. At the same time, however, the Court should also reaffirm that \'a7 2 plaintiffs satisfy the first precondition where it is possible to draw a single-member district that meets the traditional numerical majority test.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360  \b \i0 \ul0 [*5]\b0 \i0 \ul0   In Part I, we show that a functional majority test is consistent with the text of \'a7 2 and the logic of \b0 \i \ul0 Gingles.\b0 \i0 \ul0  The statute guarantees minority \b \i0 \ul0 [**7]\b0 \i0 \ul0   voters an equal "opportunity . . . to elect representatives of their choice," 42 U.S.C. \'a7 1973(b), but does not impose a numerical majority requirement as a precondition to relief. The purpose of the first \b0 \i \ul0 Gingles\b0 \i0 \ul0  precondition is to limit \'a7 2 relief to situations in which minority voters have the potential to elect candidates of their choice. Minority voters always have that potential where a numerical majority-minority district can be drawn. But real-world election data show that notwithstanding the existence of racially polarized voting, minority voters can also have the potential to elect candidates in some districts where they are not a numerical majority. Relief under \'a7 2 should not be foreclosed in such cases.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The North Carolina Supreme Court's concern that failure to adhere strictly to a bright line numerical majority test would create administrative difficulties and open a Pandora's box of new litigation is unwarranted. Proving a vote dilution claim under \'a7 2 is already a demanding task. Proving the first \b0 \i \ul0 Gingles\b0 \i0 \ul0  factor under a functional majority test will be even more demanding, because it will require additional analysis and development \b \i0 \ul0 [**8]\b0 \i0 \ul0   of additional evidence that is not part of the existing \'a7 2 calculus. Moreover, \'a7 2 imposes numerous rigorous standards that cabin the scope of vote dilution claims--including most notably the requirement that plaintiffs prove the existence of racially polarized voting--and these standards will continue to apply to claims under a functional approach. Allowing plaintiffs to proceed on a functional majority theory therefore is not likely to significantly expand the scope of existing \'a7 2 litigation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360  \b \i0 \ul0 [*6]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Nor was the North Carolina Supreme Court correct in asserting that a "bright line" rule should be applied for reasons of administrative convenience. This Court has previously rejected such rigid approaches as inconsistent with the flexible nature of the \'a7 2 inquiry. \b0 \i \ul0 See \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Johnson v. De Grandy,\b0 \i0 \ul0  512 U.S. 997, 1017-21 (1994). And in any case, contrary to the North Carolina Supreme Court's assertion, a numerical majority test is not always simple or straightforward to administer. The so-called "bright line" of the numerical majority rule is, at times in actual practice, not as clear as the expression suggests. Moreover, it can encourage the parties to engage in numerical \b \i0 \ul0 [**9]\b0 \i0 \ul0   and map-drawing disputes that distract attention from what should be the key focus under \'a7 2: whether minority voters have an equal opportunity to elect candidates of their choice.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 We show in Part II that while \'a7 2 plaintiffs should be permitted to proceed on a functional majority theory, they should not be required to do so. In other words, the Court should not simply replace the traditional numerical majority test--which courts have applied for more than two decades--with a new functional test. As \b0 \i \ul0 Gingles\b0 \i0 \ul0  and numerous lower court decisions make clear, satisfying a numerical majority test plainly suffices to establish potential to elect as a threshold matter because minority voters necessarily have the potential to elect candidates of their choice when they are an absolute majority of a district's population (even though in practice they may not do so in every case).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Moreover, requiring plaintiffs to prove their ability to elect candidates under a functional test in every case--even where it is clear that they could satisfy the simple numerical majority test--could pose a  \b \i0 \ul0 [*7]\b0 \i0 \ul0   substantial obstacle to \'a7 2 plaintiffs who would otherwise have viable claims. A significant \b \i0 \ul0 [**10]\b0 \i0 \ul0   amount of \'a7 2 litigation involves local elections for the governing bodies of small counties and municipalities. Many of these jurisdictions use at-large methods of voting or other electoral devices that this Court has recognized as being especially likely to have a discriminatory effect on minority voting strength. But in these jurisdictions, there is generally less voting data available for analysis, because there are fewer voting precincts, lower turnouts, fewer ballots cast, and often no primary elections. In such cases, even where the relevant data show a clear pattern of racially polarized voting, it may be difficult to make predictions about how a district with a particular racial composition will perform in actual practice. Yet experience shows that numerical majority-minority districts typically are an effective remedy for vote dilution in such cases. The Court should not undercut the effectiveness of this traditional remedy.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 I. Minority Voters Should Be Able To Satisfy the First \b \i \ul0 Gingles\b \i0 \ul0  Precondition Under a Functional Majority Test.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Supreme Court of North Carolina erred in holding that \'a7 2 plaintiffs can never satisfy the first  \b \i0 \ul0 [**11]\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b0 \i \ul0 Gingles\b0 \i0 \ul0  precondition unless it is possible to draw a single-member district in which minority voters are more than 50% of the eligible voting population. This Court should hold that \'a7 2 plaintiffs can also satisfy the first \b0 \i \ul0 Gingles\b0 \i0 \ul0  precondition by proving--through reliable analysis of voting patterns and other relevant data--the existence of a predictable level of white crossover voting sufficient to give minority  \b \i0 \ul0 [*8]\b0 \i0 \ul0   voters a realistic potential to elect candidates of their choice in a proposed single member-district. n5 In these circumstances, minority voters constitute a \b0 \i \ul0 functional\b0 \i0 \ul0  majority of the proposed district's voting population, even though they are not, strictly speaking, a numerical majority.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A. The Functional Majority Test Is Consistent with the Text and Purpose of \'a7 2 and the Logic of \b \i \ul0 Gingles.\b \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Nothing in the text of \'a7 2 limits relief to cases in which it is possible to draw a majority-minority district. Nor is there anything in the legislative history that requires a numerical majority. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  S. Rep. No. 97-417 (1982). The statute provides that a \'a7 2 violation is established whenever the totality of the circumstances demonstrates that minority voters have "less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice." 42 U.S.C. \'a7 1973(b). Thus, \'a7 2 focuses on whether minority voters have an equal opportunity to elect their candidates of choice--not whether they constitute an absolute numerical majority of the electorate in any given district.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Moreover, Congress did not intend for the statute to be applied in a rigid, inflexible way. As \b0 \i \ul0 Gingles\b0 \i0 \ul0  observed, \'a7 2 mandates that courts take a "'functional' view of the political process." 478 U.S. at 45 (quoting S. Rep. No. 97-417, at 30 n.120 (1982)). In keeping  \b \i0 \ul0 [*9]\b0 \i0 \ul0   with that approach,  \b \i0 \ul0 [**13]\b0 \i0 \ul0   this Court has stressed that "the \b0 \i \ul0 Gingles\b0 \i0 \ul0  factors cannot be applied mechanically and without regard to the nature of the claim." \b0 \i \ul0 Johnson v. De Grandy,\b0 \i0 \ul0  512 U.S. 997, 1007 (1994); \b0 \i \ul0 Voinovich v. Quilter,\b0 \i0 \ul0  507 U.S. 146, 158 (1993). And it has noted that the first \b0 \i \ul0 Gingles\b0 \i0 \ul0  precondition might need to be "modified or eliminated" to address a claim brought by minority voters who could not constitute a majority in a single-member district. \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The functional majority test outlined above is a reasonable and appropriate modification of the \b0 \i \ul0 Gingles\b0 \i0 \ul0  framework. The purpose of the first precondition is to limit \'a7 2 relief to cases in which minority voters have a realistic potential to elect candidates of their choice. As the Court explained, "[u]nless minority voters possess the \b0 \i \ul0 potential\b0 \i0 \ul0  to elect representatives in the absence of the challenged structure or practice, they cannot claim to have been injured by that structure or practice." 478 U.S. at 50 n.17. Likewise, in \b0 \i \ul0 De Grandy,\b0 \i0 \ul0  the Court explained that "the first \b0 \i \ul0 Gingles\b0 \i0 \ul0  condition requires the possibility of creating more than the existing number of reasonably compact \b \i0 \ul0 [**14]\b0 \i0 \ul0   districts with a sufficiently large minority population to elect candidates of its choice." 512 U.S. at 1008. This formulation of the first precondition focuses on whether minority voters have the ability to elect candidates in a given district--not whether they are an absolute numerical majority.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Of course, where minority voters are a numerical majority of a district's eligible voting population, they do have the potential to elect candidates of their choice. Hence, the simple numerical majority rule applied in \b0 \i \ul0 Gingles\b0 \i0 \ul0  makes sense, and should continue to be applied. But it does not follow that minority voters must be a numerical majority in order to have  \b \i0 \ul0 [*10]\b0 \i0 \ul0   the potential to elect candidates. \b0 \i \ul0 Gingles\b0 \i0 \ul0  recognizes that even where voting is polarized along racial lines, some crossover support for the minority's preferred candidates is likely. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  478 U.S. at 56 ("[I]n general, a white bloc vote that normally will defeat the combined strength of minority support \b0 \i \ul0 plus white 'crossover' votes\b0 \i0 \ul0  rises to the level of legally significant white bloc voting.") (emphasis added). Where there is a sufficient level of predictable crossover support,  \b \i0 \ul0 [**15]\b0 \i0 \ul0   minority voters will have the potential to elect candidates of their choice even where they are not a numerical majority. n6

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In sum, the first \b0 \i \ul0 Gingles\b0 \i0 \ul0  factor focuses not on whether minority voters are a numerical majority, but on whether they have a realistic potential \b \i0 \ul0 [**17]\b0 \i0 \ul0   to elect their preferred candidates. Logic and experience both demonstrate that minority voters can have a realistic potential to elect their preferred candidates even where they are not a numerical majority of the electorate in a given district, and in those circumstances, minority voters should not be foreclosed from relief under \'a7 2.
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 B. The North Carolina Supreme Court's Rationale for Requiring a Numerical Majority Is Unpersuasive.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The North Carolina Supreme Court's ruling in this case is not grounded in either the text of \'a7 2 or the logic of this Court's decisions in \b0 \i \ul0 Gingles\b0 \i0 \ul0  and subsequent cases. Instead, it is based on a series of policy considerations intended to show that a "bright line" numerical majority rule is the only interpretation of the first \b0 \i \ul0 Gingles\b0 \i0 \ul0  precondition that courts and legislatures can reasonably administer. \b0 \i \ul0 See \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Pender County v. Bartlett,\b0 \i0 \ul0  649 S.E.2d 364, 373--74 (N.C. 2007) (Pet.  \b \i0 \ul0 [*12]\b0 \i0 \ul0   App. 22a-25a). None of the rationales articulated by the North Carolina Supreme Court is persuasive.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 1. \b0 \i \ul0 Allowing Functional Majority Claims Will Not Lead to a Flood of New \'a7 2 Litigation.\b0 \i0 \ul0  The North Carolina Supreme Court expressed \b \i0 \ul0 [**18]\b0 \i0 \ul0   concern that without a "bright line" numerical majority rule as a threshold standard for evaluating \'a7 2 claims, there would be a "Pandora's box of marginal Voting Rights Act claims by minority groups of all sizes," 649 S.E.2d at 373 (Pet. App. 24a) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The court did not explain how it came to this conclusion, but in any event this concern is unwarranted. Proving a vote dilution claim under \'a7 2 is already a demanding task, typically requiring extensive analysis by one or more experts. This, by itself, discourages "marginal" claims. For a variety of reasons, permitting plaintiffs to satisfy the first \b0 \i \ul0 Gingles\b0 \i0 \ul0  precondition under a functional test will not significantly ease plaintiffs' burdens under the statute and therefore is not likely to cause a significant increase in \'a7 2 litigation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 First, the functional test is likely to be more demanding than the simple numerical majority test because it will require plaintiffs to undertake additional analysis and explore new lines of evidence that are generally not part of existing \'a7 2 presentations. Under the numerical majority test, proof of the first precondition is straightforward.  \b \i0 \ul0 [**19]\b0 \i0 \ul0   To make a \b0 \i \ul0 prima facie\b0 \i0 \ul0  showing, a plaintiff need only proffer a proposed district, show that it is reasonably compact, and demonstrate through the use of census data that minority voters are a majority of the eligible voting population.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360  \b \i0 \ul0 [*13]\b0 \i0 \ul0   By contrast, proof of the first \b0 \i \ul0 Gingles\b0 \i0 \ul0  factor under a functional majority test is likely to require a more complicated analysis. While the Court need not identify in this case all of the factors that might be relevant to satisfying a functional test, we note that Professors Grofman, Handley and Lublin have proposed a model that involves analysis of relative participation rates between white and minority voters, the degree of cohesion and crossover voting, the dynamics of party primaries or other multi-stage electoral processes, and the effect of incumbency. n9 Such an analysis would go beyond what is currently required to satisfy the cohesion and racial bloc voting prongs of \b0 \i \ul0 Gingles.\b0 \i0 \ul0  Depending on the availability of data, it might be difficult for plaintiffs to make the necessary showing in many cases. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  discussion \b0 \i \ul0 infra\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 24-28. Accordingly, even if a functional test is available, many \'a7 2 plaintiffs will likely \b \i0 \ul0 [**20]\b0 \i0 \ul0   continue to rely on the simple numerical majority test to prove the first precondition.

\par \fs20 \pard 
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Second, functional majority claims are inherently self-limiting. As many courts have recognized, there is some tension between the presence of a consistent level of crossover voting, as required to satisfy the first \b0 \i \ul0 Gingles\b0 \i0 \ul0  precondition under a functional test, and the third \b0 \i \ul0 Gingles\b0 \i0 \ul0  precondition, which requires proof that the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it usually to defeat the minority's preferred candidates. As noted above, \b0 \i \ul0 Gingles\b0 \i0 \ul0  recognizes that a finding of legally significant racially polarized voting is not inconsistent with some degree of white crossover voting. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  478 U.S. at 56. But the greater the extent of crossover voting, the less likely it is  \b \i0 \ul0 [*14]\b0 \i0 \ul0   that a court will find a legally sufficient level of racially polarized voting. \b0 \i \ul0 See, e.g., \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 McNeil v. Springfield Park Dist.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  851 F.2d 937, 943 n.9 (7th Cir. 1988) \b \i0 \ul0 [**21]\b0 \i0 \ul0   ("The existence of a cross-over, of course, weakens \b0 \i \ul0 pro tanto\b0 \i0 \ul0  the assumption of racial bloc voting."). Where a \'a7 2 claim is premised on a very high level of white crossover voting, it will run a correspondingly high risk of being dismissed under the third prong of \b0 \i \ul0 Gingles.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Third, minority voters cannot plausibly claim to be a functional majority in a proposed district unless they are a least a substantial minority of the district's population. How substantial that minority must be, of course, depends on the extent of crossover voting. But the fact that the threshold necessary to enable the election of minority-preferred candidates may be less than 50% does not mean that there is no threshold at all. As petitioners suggest, the minority group must, at a minimum, be "significantly larger in size than the crossover group that would be necessary for a coalition between the two to constitute a majority in the district." Pet. Br. 41.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Fourth, there are other limiting principles generally applicable in \'a7 2 litigation that will further cabin the extent of claims under a functional majority test. The most significant of these is the principle of rough proportionality discussed in \b \i0 \ul0 [**22]\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b0 \i \ul0 De Grandy.\b0 \i0 \ul0  In that case, the Court rejected the notion that \'a7 2 requires creation of the maximum possible number of majoritycontrolled districts, 512 U.S. at 1016--17, and recognized that proportionality, while not dispositive, provides a guide as to the number of effective majority-minority  \b \i0 \ul0 [*15]\b0 \i0 \ul0   districts that must be created. n10 Accordingly, the Court found no \'a7 2 violation where "minority voters form[ed] effective voting majorities in a number of districts roughly proportional to minority voters' respective shares in the voting-age population." \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 1000. This reasoning indicates that a relaxation of the numerical majority rule should not require jurisdictions to create a number of new "functional" majority districts. Under \b0 \i \ul0 De Grandy,\b0 \i0 \ul0  if a jurisdiction has created a number of districts in which minority voters have an opportunity to elect candidates of their choice that is roughly proportional to minority voters' share of the population--regardless of whether those districts are traditional majorityminority districts or functional majority-minority districts--it should not face \'a7 2 liability. n11

\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 n11 Legislatures and other redistricting bodies undoubtedly have some discretion in how they comply with their obligations under \'a7 2, including whether to comply by creating functional majority-minority districts or traditional numerical majorityminority districts. \b0 \i \ul0 Cf. \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Georgia v. Ashcroft,\b0 \i0 \ul0  539 U.S. 461, 480, 483 (2003).
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \fs20 \pard 
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Section 2 imposes other limitations as well. For example, this Court has made clear that any proposed district must be reasonably compact, which means it must "take into account traditional districting principles such as maintaining communities of interest and traditional boundaries." \b0 \i \ul0 League of United Latin  \b \i0 \ul0 [*16]\b0 \i \ul0   Am. Citizens v. Perry,\b0 \i0 \ul0  126 S. Ct. 2594, 2618 (2006) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). This rule would continue to apply to any proposed functional majority district, just as it would for any proposed numerical majority district.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Finally, it is important to bear in mind that the \b0 \i \ul0 Gingles\b0 \i0 \ul0  factors are only intended as gatekeeping conditions. Plaintiffs must still establish in every case that based upon the totality \b \i0 \ul0 [**24]\b0 \i0 \ul0   of the circumstances, minority voters have "less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice." 42 U.S.C. \'a7 1973(b); \b0 \i \ul0 see \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 De Grandy,\b0 \i0 \ul0  512 U.S. at 1011--12. Thus, the fact that \'a7 2 plaintiffs can demonstrate the possibility of drawing a district in which they are a functional majority does not mean they will ultimately prevail in a vote dilution claim.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 For all of these reasons, recognition of the functional majority test is unlikely to cause a flood of new litigation. Of course, some cases could be brought under a functional majority test that cannot be brought under a numerical majority test. But in practice, the functional approach is likely to be viable in just a few relatively discrete categories of cases. First, there are cases in which minority voters either fall just short of being a numerical majority or where there is a dispute over whether those voters constitute such a majority. Second, there are cases like this one which involve minority voters who have historically been able to elect candidates of their choice, but who do not constitute a numerical \b \i0 \ul0 [**25]\b0 \i0 \ul0   majority. Finally, there may also be a few cases in which a geographically compact and politically cohesive minority community has been divided among several districts, even though it could have constituted a functional  \b \i0 \ul0 [*17]\b0 \i0 \ul0   majority (and hence elected candidates of its choice) if the community had been left intact in one singlemember district. If the other prerequisites for a vote dilution claim can be established, \'a7 2 ought to provide a remedy in each of these circumstances.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 2. \b0 \i \ul0 A Rigid and Inflexible "Bright Line" Test Is Inconsistent With the Statute.\b0 \i0 \ul0  The North Carolina Supreme Court also stated that a "bright line" numerical majority test "promotes ease of application" and "provides [state legislatures] with a safe harbor for the redistricting process." 649 S.E.2d at 373 (Pet. App. 23a-24a). This concern is misplaced here; the North Carolina legislature had no difficulty drawing a functional majority district and the state is not arguing for strict adherence to a numerical majority rule.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 But in any case, ease of application for legislatures or other redistricting bodies is not a factor that is entitled to any significant weight in the interpretation \b \i0 \ul0 [**26]\b0 \i0 \ul0   of \'a7 2. The Voting Rights Act is designed to protect the rights of \b0 \i \ul0 citizens\b0 \i0 \ul0 --not state legislatures. Adoption of rigid and inflexible bright-line rules for reasons of administrative convenience is inconsistent with Congress's purpose. That is why the Court has not adopted bright-line rules with respect to the second and third \b0 \i \ul0 Gingles\b0 \i0 \ul0  preconditions, and why, in \b0 \i \ul0 De Grandy,\b0 \i0 \ul0  it specifically rejected an interpretation of the first precondition that would have created a "safe harbor" for legislatures. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  512 U.S. at 1018 (holding that "[a]n inflexible rule would run counter to the textual command of \'a7 2, that the presence or absence of a violation be assessed 'based on the totality of the circumstances'") (quoting 42 U.S.C. \'a7 1973(b)).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360  \b \i0 \ul0 [*18]\b0 \i0 \ul0   3. \b0 \i \ul0 The "Bright Line" Test Is Not Always So Clear.\b0 \i0 \ul0  The North Carolina Supreme Court's statement that a numerical majority rule is "straightforward and easily administered" and can be applied "fairly, equally, and consistently," 649 S.E.2d at 373 (Pet. App. 23a), also overstates the case. More than two decades of experience with the numerical majority test have demonstrated \b \i0 \ul0 [**27]\b0 \i0 \ul0   that the so-called "bright line" is not always so clear in actual practice. Further, the rule can have the undesirable effect of encouraging disputes over numerical issues and map drawing, which distract attention from what should be the proper focus under \'a7 2: creating districts in which minority voters have a realistic opportunity elect candidates of their choice.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Fifth Circuit's decision in \b0 \i \ul0 Valdespino v. Alamo Heights Independent School District,\b0 \i0 \ul0  168 F.3d 848 (5th Cir. 1999), is a case in point. In that case, Hispanic voters challenged the use of at-large elections for positions on a seven-member board of trustees for a local school district. Using 1990 census data, they demonstrated that it was possible to divide the school districts into seven single-member districts, including one in which minority voters would constitute a majority of the citizen voting-age population. Thus, based on census data, there should have been no question that plaintiffs satisfied a "bright line" numerical majority test.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Nonetheless, the district court held that plaintiffs had not cleared the hurdle of the first \b0 \i \ul0 Gingles\b0 \i0 \ul0  precondition. It permitted the school district to introduce \b \i0 \ul0 [**28]\b0 \i0 \ul0   evidence that, since the time of the census, one large apartment complex in the proposed majorityHispanic district had been renovated and had lost population, while another large apartment complex  \b \i0 \ul0 [*19]\b0 \i0 \ul0   had been built outside the district, increasing population there. Taking these changes into account, the school district's expert concluded that it was not possible to draw a district in which Hispanic voters were more than 48.3% of the citizen voting-age population ("CVAP"). The district court credited this analysis and denied relief, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding that \b0 \i \ul0 Gingles\b0 \i0 \ul0  mandates a strict, bright-line numerical majority rule.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Fifth Circuit's decision reflects an unduly rigid and formalistic interpretation of \'a7 2. This Court has long recognized the discriminatory potential of atlarge election schemes like the one at issue in \b0 \i \ul0 Valdespino. See, e.g., \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Growe v. Emison,\b0 \i0 \ul0  507 U.S. 25, 40 (1993) ("We have . . . stated on many occasions that multimember districting plans, as well as atlarge plans, generally pose greater threats to minority-voter participation in the political process than do single-member districts . . . ."). n12 Where voting is \b \i0 \ul0 [**29]\b0 \i0 \ul0   sharply polarized along racial lines in such a jurisdiction, minority voters have as a practical matter no realistic opportunity to elect candidates of their choice in any election. In such circumstances, minority voters' ability to participate in the political process is curtailed just as effectively as if they had been denied access to the ballot altogether. Under the  \b \i0 \ul0 [*20]\b0 \i0 \ul0   facts of \b0 \i \ul0 Valdespino,\b0 \i0 \ul0  however, it seems likely that minority voters could have had a realistic opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice if at-large voting had been replaced by a single-member district system, regardless of whether they were a strict 51% majority of CVAP--as the census data showed--or merely a substantial 48.3% minority in a proposed district. If plaintiffs had been given the option of proceeding under a functional test, they would have had an opportunity to prove their ability to elect candidates in their proposed district; instead, they were denied relief altogether.

Glades County Board of County Commissioners,\b0 \i0 \ul0  493 F.3d 1253 (11th Cir. 2007), similarly illustrates that the so-called "bright line" rule is not so clear. That case involved a challenge to an at-large voting scheme in a small county, with a voting-age population ("VAP") of 8,329. Plaintiffs demonstrated that it was possible to draw a single-member district in which African Americans were 50.23% of VAP--a very small majority, but a majority nonetheless. Nonetheless, the district court held that the first \b0 \i \ul0 Gingles\b0 \i0 \ul0  precondition was not satisfied because the record did not contain evidence of "voter registrations, voting rates, or voter practices which would give real world meaning to the statistically sufficient district." \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 1262. A divided panel of the Eleventh Circuit reversed, holding--over a dissent from Judge Tjoflat--that (1) "[a] majority is a majority, by however how small a margin," \b0 \i \ul0 id.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  (2) there was no evidence to suggest that the white minority, at 33% of VAP, would turn out in sufficient force to outvote the African-American majority, and (3) in any event, there was sufficient white crossover voting to enable minority \b \i0 \ul0 [**31]\b0 \i0 \ul0   voters to elect candidates of choice in the  \b \i0 \ul0 [*21]\b0 \i0 \ul0   proposed district. But the Eleventh Circuit subsequently vacated the panel decision and granted \b0 \i \ul0 en banc\b0 \i0 \ul0  review. \b0 \i \ul0 See \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Thompson v. Glades County Bd. of County Comm'rs,\b0 \i0 \ul0  508 F.3d 975 (11th Cir. 2007) (en banc). Thus, it is still unclear in the Eleventh Circuit whether even a literal majority is necessarily sufficient to satisfy the first precondition.
\par \b0 \i \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Thompson\b0 \i0 \ul0  again illustrates the difficulties in attaching talismanic significance to a numerical majority as the \b0 \i \ul0 only\b0 \i0 \ul0  measure of a minority group's ability to elect candidates. This rigid approach encourages manipulation of numbers and indeed, the very concept of a "numerical majority." By contrast, recognition of a functional approach would discourage legislatures and courts from drawing fine distinctions between a 49.5% minority district and a 50.5% minority district--a difference that is unlikely to have much impact in the real world--and instead focus their attention on whether the plan, as a whole, has the effect of diluting minority voting strength.

App. 24a) (quoting \b0 \i \ul0 McNeil v. Springfield Park Dist.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  851 F.2d 937, 943 (7th Cir. 1988)). This statement highlights the problem with a rigid bright-line rule. We are not aware of any principle of law that permits a federal court to close its doors to plaintiffs with a potentially meritorious \'a7 2 claim merely for reasons of administrative convenience or because it doubts that the claim will ultimately be successful. As we have shown, there are some circumstances in which minority voters who do not have an equal opportunity  \b \i0 \ul0 [*22]\b0 \i0 \ul0   to elect candidates of their choice under an existing electoral system could elect candidates of their choice under an alternative system--notwithstanding their inability to satisfy the numerical majority test.

The majority opinion in \b0 \i \ul0 Gingles\b0 \i0 \ul0  properly recognized that a numerical majority is sufficient to demonstrate that minority voters have the "\b0 \i \ul0 potential\b0 \i0 \ul0  to elect representatives." 478 U.S. at 50 n.17. Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion makes  \b \i0 \ul0 [*23]\b0 \i0 \ul0   the same point: "It is true that a minority \b \i0 \ul0 [**34]\b0 \i0 \ul0   group that could constitute a majority in a single-member district ordinarily has the potential ability to elect representatives without white support . . . ." 478 U.S. at 90 n.1 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). n13

But Congress did not intend to guarantee minority voters a 100% chance of success in any election. Instead, the statute guarantees minority voters an equal "\b0 \i \ul0 opportunity\b0 \i0 \ul0  . . . to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice." 42 U.S.C. \'a7 1973(b) (emphasis added).

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The courts of appeals have likewise consistently recognized that minority voters can elect candidates of their choice where they meet a numerical majority test. For example, the Fourth Circuit has stated that "minority voters have the potential to elect a candidate \b0 \i \ul0 on the strength\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b \i0 \ul0 [**35]\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b0 \i \ul0  of their own ballots\b0 \i0 \ul0  when they can form a majority of the voters in some singlemember district." \b0 \i \ul0 Hall v. Commonwealth of Virginia,\b0 \i0 \ul0  385 F.3d 421, 429 (4th Cir. 2004). n14 In short, the numerical majority threshold is an appropriate proxy for identifying viable \'a7 2 claims because it represents the point at which minority voters can elect candidates of their choice without \b0 \i \ul0 any\b0 \i0 \ul0  crossover support.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 There are also intensely practical reasons why the Court should not abandon the traditional numerical majority standard. As discussed \b0 \i \ul0 supra\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 12--13, a functional majority test is likely to be more demanding than the simple numerical majority test because of the need for additional data and analysis. The functional approach is likely to be especially problematic in cases involving local elections for governing bodies (\b0 \i \ul0 e.g.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  city councils, county commissions, and local school boards) in small counties and municipalities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 A substantial amount of \'a7 2 litigation involves local election practices in these kinds of small jurisdictions--many of which employ at-large voting, multimember districts, or other devices that are likely to dilute minority voting strength. n15 For example, in \b0 \i \ul0 Thompson,\b0 \i0 \ul0  African American plaintiffs challenged the use of at-large elections for the county commission and school board in a county with a voting age population of only 8,329 people. 493 F.3d at 1256. And in \b0 \i \ul0 Cottier v. City of Martin,\b0 \i0 \ul0  445 F.3d 1113 (8th Cir. 2006), \b \i0 \ul0 [**37]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Native American plaintiffs challenged the use of multimember districts in city council elections  \b \i0 \ul0 [*25]\b0 \i0 \ul0   in a city of only 1,078 people. n16 In these kinds of cases, plaintiffs who currently have a remedy under \'a7 2 might not have a remedy if they were not permitted to rely on a numerical test. Requiring the use of a functional test would therefore undercut the statute's effectiveness as a remedy for vote dilution.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Proving vote dilution in local elections in small jurisdictions is materially different from proving vote dilution in the context of Congressional or state legislative redistricting cases because there are typically \b \i0 \ul0 [**38]\b0 \i0 \ul0   fewer voting precincts, fewer voters and lower voter turnout for purely local elections, and in many cases no primaries. Minority voters in these jurisdictions may be able to satisfy the cohesion and racial bloc voting prongs of \b0 \i \ul0 Gingles\b0 \i0 \ul0  through a combination of statistical analysis and anecdotal evidence, including the lack of success of minority-preferred candidates. n17 But proving that minority voters have the potential to elect candidates of their choice will require \'a7 2 plaintiffs to make predictions about future voting behavior based on an analysis of past voting behavior and the racial composition of the proposed district. As noted above, this will likely require a statistical analysis of relative voter participation rates and the degree of minority and white voter cohesion and crossover voting, and potentially many other factors. n18  \b \i0 \ul0 [*26]\b0 \i0 \ul0   In small jurisdictions, the data may be insufficient to enable either side to conduct this analysis with sufficient statistical significance to make reliable predictions about the threshold population level necessary to give minority voters an equal opportunity to elect their candidates of choice. In other words, even when the data \b \i0 \ul0 [**39]\b0 \i0 \ul0   are clear in their general pattern--unambiguously showing racially polarized voting--they may be ambiguous in their specifics, hindering reliable predictions about future voting behavior. Minority voters should not be foreclosed from relief under \'a7 2 just because they hail from a small county or town with fewer data points for analysis in circumstances where other available information sheds the necessary light.

The Ninth Circuit acknowledged this depressive effect in \b0 \i \ul0 Gomez v. City of Watsonville,\b0 \i0 \ul0  863 F.2d 1407 (9th Cir. 1988). In reversing a district court's finding that a low turnout rate among Hispanic voters evidenced a lack of cohesiveness, the court noted that "[l]ow voter registration and turnout have often been considered evidence of minority voters' lack of \b0 \i \ul0 ability\b0 \i0 \ul0  to participate effectively in the political process" and that "depressed  \b \i0 \ul0 [*27]\b0 \i0 \ul0   registration rates may often be traceable in part to historical discrimination." \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 1416 n.4. n19

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The aftermath of \b0 \i \ul0 Gomez\b0 \i0 \ul0  demonstrates the limitations of an approach that relies on historical patterns to predict future voting behavior. Following the Ninth Circuit's decision, the at-large voting system in Watsonville was replaced with a system of singlemember districts. A study of voter behavior in Watsonville concluded that the district system "effectively broke a racial barrier that kept Latino and other minority candidates from winning city council offices," paving the way for the election of a Latino mayor two years later. n20 Notably, it also led to a significant increase in Hispanic voter turnout. n21 Other studies have documented a similar effect. n22 Thus when dilution is remedied by creation of a majorityminority district, it is reasonable to expect that minority participation will increase, and minorities will have a greater opportunity to elect candidates of their choice than the backward-looking functional  \b \i0 \ul0 [*28]\b0 \i0 \ul0   analysis would suggest. This effect is difficult to quantify through statistical analysis, but that does not make it any less real.
