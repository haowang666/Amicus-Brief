\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The FCC's minority ownership policies are a constitutional remedy to societal and industry related discrimination that has led to an absence of significant minority perspective in the broadcast media.  The historic relationship between Congress and the FCC make it clear, that these policies could not have been considered, instituted or maintained without the encouragement and insistence of Congress.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Congressionally mandated minority ownership policies now under review, do nothing more than apply the principle that has been the hallmark of FCC regulation for six decades: that diversity of ownership leads to diversity of perspective.  This principle embodies the FCC's attempt to promote First Amendment values without government regulation of or supervision over speech.  Thus the minority ownership policies are consistent with Congressional and \b \i0 \ul0 [*8]\b0 \i0 \ul0   FCC policy of promoting vigorous public debate - not by imposing content restrictions on broadcasters - but by permitting different voices to be heard.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Over the years, every governmental body that has examined the issue, from the Kerner Commission, to the FCC, to Congress, to the courts themselves, have found that the perspective of minorities has been absent from the media, and that the solution to this dilemma was to increase minority participation and ownership.  The history and development of African American participation in the media, print and broadcast, demonstrates that media owned by African Americans brings a distinctive perspective to the qualitative judgments involved in presenting news and entertainment.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 I.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 HISTORICALLY CONGRESS HAS IMPOSED ITS WILL ON THE FCC THROUGH A VARIETY OF FORMAL AND INFORMAL MEANS
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The assertion that "Congress acts only by enacting legislation" n1 completely ignores the reality of the six decades of interaction between Congress and FCC That is, despite its broad regulatory independence, Congress has, since the creation of the Commission, actively sought to constrain the FCC from exceeding the bounds of its statutory mandate.  \b \i0 \ul0 [*9]\b0 \i0 \ul0   n2 First, the statutory limit on the tenure of commissioners, and the requirement that the Senate confirm all appointments to the Commission are built in sources of Congressional control. n3 In addition, Congress has repeatedly used such techniques as Congressional investigations, control over FCC appropriations, moratoria, and standing committee oversight, as well as substantive legislation, and the threat of legislation to assert its authority over the Commission.

Federal Communications Commission, et al., No. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 89-453,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  p. 15.  The Solicitor General apparently uses this reference to infer that the appropriations riders which Congress passed to prevent the reevaluation of the minority enhancement programs should not be considered as legislation, or as an expression of Congressional intent.
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n2 Newton Minow, former Chairman of the F.C.C., recounts the following encounter with Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn shortly after being appointed Chairman.  According to Mr. Minow, Speaker Rayburn embraced him and said: "Just remember one thing son.  Your agency is an arm of the Congress.  You belong to us.  Remember that, and you'll be all right." The Speaker went on to warn Minow to expect pressure, but Minow recalls, "what he did not tell me was that most of the pressure would come from the Congress itself".  Minow, Book Review, 68 Colum. L. Rev., 383, 383-4 (1968).

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Communications regulation began in this country with the Radio Act of 1927, n4 which contained the general public interest standard and delegated broad authority to the Radio Commission.  Congressional distrust of this authority burgeoned almost immediately, however, and the Communications Act of 1934 repealed the Radio Act and transferred its grant of power to the Federal Communications Commission.  In the ensuing six decades, Congress has enacted "relatively little" legislation regulating broadcast programming. n5 Thus statutory control, the most obvious congressional activity, "is noteworthy for its relative unimportance in broadcast regulation". n6

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Despite the relative dearth of substantive legislation restricting or extending the FCC's broad mandate of authority, Congress has maintained a close watch over Commission activity and has had a tremendous amount of influence in the formulation and direction of FCC rules and regulations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The FCC's status as an independent agency amplifies its dependence on Congress.  That is, independent agencies:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 are not part of any executive department, they must function without the political protection of the President or cabinet officer.  They also lack any effective means of appealing for popular support.  As a result, members of Congress have little fear of political reprisal when interacting with these defenseless agencies. n7

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In fact, the lack of substantive legislative guidelines for the FCC makes it all the more vulnerable to other forms of congressional influence. n8 According to Paul E. Comstock, a former vice president and general counsel for the National Association of Broadcasters, "[m]ost \b \i0 \ul0 [*12]\b0 \i0 \ul0   of our work is done with congressional committees.  We concentrate on Congress.  We firmly believe that the FCC will do whatever Congress tells it to do, and will not do anything Congress tells it not to do." n9

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 From its inception, and for the first three decades of its existence, the FCC was almost always under Congressional investigation or the threat of one.  Indeed, "probably no other federal agency has been the object of as much prolonged investigation by Congress as the FCC" n10 For fifteen years prior to the adoption of "network regulations", Congress pressured the FCC, and before that the Radio Commission, on the issue of whether, and how, to regulate the growth of radio networks.  During that period, "in virtually every session of Congress, the evils of monopoly in the broadcasting industry were oratorically deplored, and the FCC was frequently chided for not riding herd on network practices. n11

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 By helping to keep the FCC responsive and attuned to the wishes and expectations of segments of the public, as expressed through Congress, they illustrated just how effective properly conducted investigations could be in achieving some of the goals of Congressional oversight. n14

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 As the pace of deregulation accelerated during the Reagan years, Congress began to respond specifically to attacks on various FCC rules.  In a rider to the Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, Congress revoked the FCC's permanent authorization and placed it on a two-year authorization, in keeping with its treatment of other executive agencies during this period. n15 This allowed Congress \b \i0 \ul0 [*14]\b0 \i0 \ul0   to amend the Communications Act every two years.  The new authorization also allows Congress to influence FCC policy in less formal ways. n16 The Conference Report reasoned that
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 regular and systematic oversight will increase the Commission's accountability for the implementation of Congressional policy. . . .  The Commission, in turn, will have a better appreciation of Congressional intent.

At the end of World War II, 95% of the federal budget was under permanent authorization.  In the 1970's, Congress shifted an increasing number of agencies to annual or multi-year authorizations.  Approximately one half of the budget remains under permanent authorization.
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n16 Krasnow and Shooshan, supra 303.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Though less formal methods of Congressional influence can work tremendous reversals at the FCC, Congress has used the appropriations process both often and creatively in its ongoing effort to control the activities of the Commission.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Each house of Congress has promulgated internal rules limiting the \b \i0 \ul0 [*15]\b0 \i0 \ul0   use of appropriations riders to enact substantive legislation n17.  Nevertheless, Congress has frequently used appropriations riders to enforce its will on the Commission.  This has become even more evident since the FCC was placed on two-year authorization in 1981. n18

These rules are not constitutionally compelled, and are frequently waived.
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n18 Congress has absolute discretion not only over the amount of money allocated to the Commission but also over the purposes for which such funds are to be used.  Subcommittees of both houses' Appropriations Committees hold annual hearings to examine the F.C.C.'s budget requests and to question the commissioners and top-level staff.  Many opportunities exist, both at these hearings and elsewhere, for the subcommittees to "scrutinize FCC behavior and to communicate legislative desires to the officials involved . . .  Although the reports are not law, the Appropriations Committees expect that they will be regarded almost as seriously as if they were".  R. Fenno, The Power of the Purse, (1966), see generally and at 18.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Appropriations riders come in two forms: positive and negative.  Congress uses both to control the FCC.  Positive riders require some action on the part of the Commission; such as the 1987 rider requiring the FCC to consider alternative means of enforcing the Fairness Doctrine and to report its findings to Congress. n19 Negative riders, known as limitation riders, restrict the Commission's ability to spend funds or to rescind or modify an existing policy.  This is the type of rider used in 1988 to prohibit the FCC from reexamining its minority and female preference policies, which Congress has extended through fiscal years 1989 and 1990. n20 Appropriations riders sometimes express legislative intent concerning the policy or practice at issue.  For example, in the minority preference limitation rider the Senate Appropriations Committee explained:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Congress has expressed its support for such policies in the past and has found that promoting diversity of ownership of broadcast properties satisfies important public policy goals.  Diversity of ownership results in diversity of programming and improved service to minority . . . audiences. n21

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The appropriations riders at issue in this case prohibit the FCC from spending money to rescind a policy that had been in effect for over ten years and had been addressed by Congress in the past only positively.  The only feasible intent behind the riders, amply supported by the legislative history and the earlier legislation that prodded the FCC to develop minority preferences in the first place, is that Congress supported the preferences as they had been crafted by the FCC. n22

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In 1983, Congress used a negative rider to block the FCC's liberalization of its television group ownership rules. n23 This forced the FCC to reconsider, hold hearings, and eventually modify the rule to Congress' liking. n24 An appropriations rider in the 1988 Act "prohibited the FCC from modifying its rules limiting newspaper-television cross-ownership and from extending any existing waivers from those limits." n25 In the Commission's 1989 appropriations package, Congress directed the agency to promulgate regulations before January 31, 1989, aimed at enforcing the restrictions \b \i0 \ul0 [*18]\b0 \i0 \ul0   on broadcast indecency in 18 U.S.C. 1464 on a 24-hour a day basis. n26

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Occasionally Appropriations Committees have worked their will without legislation of any kind.  In 1974, a well-publicized struggle between the FCC and Congress raged over the issue of sex and violence in television programming.  During the 1960's and early 1970's, Congress had held a number of hearings about such programming.  Finally, frustrated with what it perceived to be inadequate Commission attention to the problem, the House Appropriations Committee issued \b \i0 \ul0 [*19]\b0 \i0 \ul0   a report that, in strong language, gave the Commission a deadline for submission of a report outlining its proposals. n27 The report warned that while [T]he Committee is reluctant to take punitive action to require the Commission to heed the views of the Congress, and to carry out its responsibilities . . . if this is what is required to achieve the desired objectives, such action may be considered. n28

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Another means of Congressional oversight and control of the Commission is the use of moratoria.  Moratoria are conceptually similar to negative appropriations riders.  However, rather than prohibiting the expenditure of funds, they merely disallow the agency from implementing \b \i0 \ul0 [*20]\b0 \i0 \ul0   a certain rule or decision for a given period of time.  Though a moratorium and an accompanying report may convey Congressional views on an issue, its usual purpose is to give Congress time to review the issue.  Thus a moratorium is usually used at one stage in an ongoing process of Congressional influence.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Congress first imposed a moratorium on the FCC in the 98th Congress, amidst the syndication and financial interest controversy. n32 The same Congress imposed a six-month moratorium to prevent the FCC from repealing the political attack and editorializing rules. n33

For instance, Congress in 1984 strongly opposed the FCC's efforts to modify and eventually eliminate its restrictions on group ownership of media interest.  Shortly after the Commission announced its final decision to replace the rule with a more lenient version that would sunset in five years, n34 Congress imposed a moratorium on the agency's implementation of the revision. n35 \b \i0 \ul0 [*21]\b0 \i0 \ul0   During the moratorium, the FCC suspended its "final order", considered the legislators' views, and ultimately decided upon a rule similar to the lenient one previously announced but with a few additional features and without the automatic sunset provision. n36

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The study defines "narrowcasting" as arising where the minority ownership targets their own racial/ethnic community as a focus of service, and "mainstreaming" as where the minority ownership targets the general community in a manner common to commercial broadcast TV outlets, but imbues their service with a commitment to cultural pluralism rarely seen in majority-controlled TV outlets.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This study concluded that "narrowcasting" stations such as KORO and WGPR sought "to use a major form a mass communication to validate and to showcase a minority culture" and "to create a broadcast institution that can function as a resource for a minority community at the local level". n70 Minority owned mainstreaming stations, such as WLBT were seen as attempting "to use a major form of mass communication to legitimize different components of the same community".

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 CONGRESS HAS BROAD DISCRETION TO DETERMINE THE HARM DONE BY RACIAL DISCRIMINATION AND TO FORMULATE A REMEDY FOR THAT DISCRIMINATION
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 109 S.Ct 706 (1989), this Court held that racial preferences granted by state or local governments violate the Fourteenth Amendment's ban on governmental discrimination unless they are narrowly tailored to meet a compelling public interest.  Thus while Croson marked the first time that a majority of the Court adopted strict scrutiny in the affirmative action context, it cannot be read as prohibiting Congress from taking race-conscious action when it is necessary to meet a compelling public interest.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Indeed, even as applied to state and local governments, if the strict scrutiny components are met, then remedial race-conscience measures will be upheld.  On the other hand, the Court \b \i0 \ul0 [*43]\b0 \i0 \ul0   in Croson acknowledged that the constitutional requirements are less stringent for the remedial race-conscience measures enacted by the federal government, than for those enacted by state and local governments.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Relying on and reaffirming Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U.S. 448 (1980), Justice O'Connor explicitly recognizes that Congress possesses "unique remedial powers" that enables it to use race-conscious relief where states and cities cannot.  Croson, 109 S.Ct. at 718. n75 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n75 The Solicitor General concedes that the nature of the Congress demands that its determinations in this area be given greater deference then that accorded state and local bodies under Croson. However, notwithstanding that concession the Solicitor General so narrowly defines the scope of that deference so as to leave it a distinction without a difference.  U.S. Brief, Metro at 12.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The distinctions that Croson acknowledged between federal and state power to use race-conscious measures means that even applying strict scrutiny, Congress retains significant discretion.  It follows that the broader federal authority allows Congress to establish the factual predicate for its racial \b \i0 \ul0 [*44]\b0 \i0 \ul0   preferences without making findings of the same degree of precision and specificity as states and their subdivisions.  Moreover, in analyzing whether a federal remedy is "narrowly tailored" to achieve a compelling interest, the courts must similarly pay more deference to Congress' selection of the appropriate remedy then they would to the choices of state and local governments.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Examining the factual predicate of the plan at issue in Croson, this Court held that local government officials could only impose a race-conscious remedy if they had sufficient evidence of identified discrimination in a particular industry within their jurisdiction.  Mere societal discrimination against minorities was held to be insufficient as a factual predicate.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Conversely, the Court reiterated the holding of Fullilove, that Congress "may identify and redress the effects of society-wide discrimination".  Croson, 109 S.Ct. at 719. In Fullilove, the Court found it unnecessary for Congress to have had before it evidence of identified instances of racial discrimination in the national construction industry.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Of course, this does not imply that Congress need make no findings whatsoever, or that \b \i0 \ul0 [*45]\b0 \i0 \ul0   it can simply take legislative notice of our nation's sordid history in race relations.  However, in assessing the effects of societal discrimination in the broadcast industry, Congress must certainly be free to rely upon "information and expertise that Congress acquires in the consideration and enactment of earlier legislation", Fullilove, supra, 448 U.S. at 502-503, and the courts should pay due deference to that expertise.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Contrary to the arguments of the Solicitor General, Congressional remedies need not be so narrowly tailored as to be "victim specific". n76
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 [I]t is agreed that a plan need not be limited to the remedying of specific instances of identified discrimination for it to be deemed sufficiently "narrowly tailored," or "substantially related," to the correction of prior discrimination by the state actor.

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This Court has not limited its endorsement of sufficiently compelling justifications for racial classification to remedying the effects of identified present or past racial discrimination.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 a state interest \b \i0 \ul0 [*46]\b0 \i0 \ul0   in the promotion of racial diversity has been found sufficiently "compelling", at least in the context of higher education, to support the use of racial considerations in furthering that interest.

EPC, 425 U.S. 662, 670 n.7 (1976), (FCC regulations dealing with employment practices "can be justified as necessary to enable the FCC to satisfy its obligation under the Communications Act of 1934 . . . to ensure that its licensees' programming fairly reflects the tastes and viewpoints of minority groups.") See also, Croson, 109 S.Ct. at 731 & n.2 (Stevens, J., concurring).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The principle predicate for all race-conscious measures is the awareness that past discrimination and exclusion has continuing effects which the society wishes to change.  However, those effects are not limited to individual victims of discrimination, or to members of the community who share the economic deprivation and discrimination, directly and indirectly.  Rather, the effects include the harm done to the society as a whole,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*47]\b0 \i0 \ul0   which denies itself the full benefit of the genius, labor and enthusiasm of a significant number of its citizens.

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The minority ownership policies seek to enhance diversity in perspective in the broadcast media: a First Amendment imperative that overlaps with the Commission's mandate to regulate the industry in the public interest, without directly regulating content.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This goal intersects with the Equal Protection values of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, in that prior discrimination, both societal and industry specific, has lead to a lack of minority perspective and participation in the broadcast media.
