Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 37.3, \b0 \i \ul0 Amici Curiae\b0 \i0 \ul0  state that all parties have consented to the filing of this brief; blanket letters of consent have been filed with the Clerk of the Court.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This brief is filed on behalf of the National Bar Association, the Hispanic National Bar Association, the National Asian Pacific American Bar Association, and the National Native American Bar Association (collectively, "\b0 \i \ul0 Amici\b0 \i0 \ul0 "). \b0 \i \ul0 Amici\b0 \i0 \ul0  are bar associations whose members are predominantly minorities. \b0 \i \ul0 Amici\b0 \i0 \ul0  are partners in the Coalition of Bar Associations of Color, which was established in 1992. Members of the coalition meet annually to discuss issues of mutual concern and to advocate in support of shared interests with the executive branch and with elected officials.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The National Bar Association is the largest and oldest association of predominantly African-American attorneys and judges in the United States. The National Bar Association was founded in 1925 when there were only 1,000 African-American attorneys in the entire country and when other national bar associations, such as the American Bar Association ("ABA"), did not admit African-American attorneys. Throughout its history, the National Bar Association consistently has advocated on behalf of African Americans and other minority populations regarding  \b \i0 \ul0 [*2]\b0 \i0 \ul0   issues affecting the legal profession. The National Bar Association represents approximately 44,000 lawyers, judges, law professors, and law students, and it has over eighty affiliate chapters throughout the world.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Hispanic National Bar Association is a nonprofit, nonpartisan, national professional association that represents the interests of over 100,000 attorneys, judges, law professors, legal assistants, and law students of Hispanic descent in the United States, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands. The Hispanic National Bar Association has thirty-eight affiliated bars in various states across the country. The Hispanic National Bar Association's continuing mission is to improve the study, practice, and administration of justice for all Americans by ensuring the meaningful participation of Hispanics in the legal profession.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The National Asian Pacific American Bar Association is the national association of Asian Pacific-American attorneys, judges, law professors, and law students, representing the interests of more than sixty state and local Asian Pacific-American bar associations and over 40,000 attorneys who work in solo practices, large firms, corporations, legal services organizations, nonprofit organizations, law schools, and government agencies. Since its inception in 1988, the National Asian Pacific American Bar Association has served as the national voice for Asian Pacific Americans in the legal profession and has promoted justice, equity, and opportunity for Asian Pacific Americans. The National Asian Pacific American Bar Association believes that there is a compelling  \b \i0 \ul0 [*3]\b0 \i0 \ul0   governmental interest in achieving diversity in higher education and supports upholding the use of race-conscious admissions programs in education. The National Asian Pacific American Bar Association opposes the use of Asian Pacific Americans as a wedge group in debates about affirmative action. n2

Both the Coalition of Bar Associations of Color and AAJC have a longstanding commitment to serving the needs of Asian Pacific Americans and all communities of color, and the National Asian Pacific American Bar Association supports both briefs.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The National Native American Bar Association is the oldest and largest association of predominantly Native-American attorneys in the United States. n3 The National Native American Bar Association was founded in 1973 when the first group of Native-American attorneys was entering the legal profession. The National Native American Bar Association's core mission since its inception has been to promote the development of Native-American attorneys. Native Americans comprise one of the smallest groups of attorneys of color in the nation, totaling approximately 2,500. The National Native American Bar Association is committed to increasing the number of Native-American students who attend college and continue their education to attend law school. The National Native American Bar Association and its chapters are involved in pipeline initiatives to promote the  \b \i0 \ul0 [*4]\b0 \i0 \ul0   recruitment and retention of Native-American law students and law faculty. And an initiative of the National Native American Bar Association is to increase the appointment of Native Americans to the state and federal judiciaries; there are currently no Native-American Article III judges.

\par \fs20 \b0 \i \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Amici\b0 \i0 \ul0  have a deep interest in this case because the legal profession, which has had a long history of discrimination against racial minorities, is strengthened by racial and ethnic diversity. Diversity benefits all sectors of the legal profession, including both minority and non-minority members of the judiciary, lawyers, and clients. Diversity has these benefits because a diverse legal profession is better able to create and test new and innovative legal principles and ideas. For both minority and non-minority lawyers and judges, a diverse legal profession creates heightened sensitivity to the particular legal problems that minorities confront and the contexts for those legal challenges. A diverse legal profession also broadens the availability and effectiveness of legal representation, including by facilitating the provision of legal services to historically underserved communities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Race-conscious college admissions programs enhance educational opportunities for minorities, thus creating a pipeline for greater minority participation in law schools and then through all levels of the legal system. Consequently, race-conscious college admissions programs are integral to achieving a critical mass of minorities in law schools and promoting diversity throughout the legal profession,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*5]\b0 \i0 \ul0   which is a compelling governmental interest. n4 Accordingly, the University of Texas's program should be upheld.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This Court has long held that there is a compelling governmental interest in achieving and maintaining diversity in our Nation's educational system, and accordingly it has upheld race-conscious admissions programs directed at obtaining a "critical mass" of minority students. n5 This Court has recognized that diversity in the educational system not only has significant benefits for both minority and \b \i0 \ul0 [**11]\b0 \i0 \ul0   non-minority students' educational experiences but also creates a necessary pipeline for diversity in the Nation's professional ranks.

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In \b0 \i \ul0 Regents of the University of California v. Bakke,\b0 \i0 \ul0  for example, this Court's plurality opinion stated that "[t]he Nation's future depends upon leaders trained through wide exposure to that robust exchange of ideas which discovers truth 'out of a multitude of tongues, [rather] than through any kind of authoritative selection.'" n6 More recently, in \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter v. Bollinger,\b0 \i0 \ul0  this Court noted that "[e]ffective participation by members of all racial and ethnic groups in the civic life of our Nation is essential if the dream of one Nation, indivisible, is to be realized." n7

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 There is no profession that benefits from diversity and civic engagement more than the legal  \b \i0 \ul0 [*7]\b0 \i0 \ul0    \b \i0 \ul0 [**12]\b0 \i0 \ul0   profession because "law schools represent the training ground for a large number of the Nation's leaders," and "legal learning and practice . . . cannot be effective in isolation from the individuals and institutions with which the law interacts." n8 Since the Court decided \b0 \i \ul0 Bakke\b0 \i0 \ul0  and \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter,\b0 \i0 \ul0  the profession has made great strides to diversify legal institutions, including private law firms and the judiciary.

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Progress, though, should not be confused with success. Racial minorities continue to be woefully underrepresented in virtually all segments of the legal profession, with certain racial minorities continuing to have almost no representation. For example, while African Americans equal more than 12% percent of the population, only 1.71% percent of law firm partners are African American. n9 Similarly, Hispanic Americans represent approximately 16% of the population, but only 1.92% of law firm partners, n10 and Asian Pacific Americans account for 4.76% of population, but only 2.36% of law firm partners. n11 Moreover, although Native Americans make \b \i0 \ul0 [**13]\b0 \i0 \ul0   up nearly 1% of the population, nationwide, there are too few Native-  \b \i0 \ul0 [*8]\b0 \i0 \ul0   American partners for the National Association of Law Placement ("NALP") to have included them in its study of minority legal employment. n12

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 There is a similar lack of diversity in the judiciary. For example, in 2009, only 12.8% of judges sitting on state supreme courts nationwide were minorities. n13 And these statistics are even more dire when viewed at the individual state level. For example, in New Mexico, where minorities account for 57% of the population, minorities made up only \b \i0 \ul0 [**14]\b0 \i0 \ul0   15% and 18% of intermediate and trial court judges, respectively. n14

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Because of the continuing need to foster diversity in the legal profession, programs that enhance the opportunities for members of racial minorities in higher education -- like the one at the University of Texas -- are necessary. Indeed, if such programs were abolished, the impact on diversity in higher education would be significant. When race-conscious admissions programs were abolished in California, for instance, the population of racial minorities suffered as their admission into colleges and universities plummeted. In turn, the number of racial minorities entering into post-graduate education was disproportionately low,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*9]\b0 \i0 \ul0   with fewer racial minorities ultimately entering the legal profession.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 California's experience indicates that, if this Court were to \b \i0 \ul0 [**15]\b0 \i0 \ul0   overturn the University of Texas's race-conscious admissions program (and other similar programs), there likely would be a significant drop in the number of racial minorities admitted into colleges and universities, ultimately and necessarily reducing the number of racial minorities who enter law school and the legal profession. \b0 \i \ul0 Amici\b0 \i0 \ul0  thus support the constitutionality of the University of Texas's race-conscious admissions program, which furthers the compelling governmental interest in diversity both in education and in the legal profession.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Significant efforts have been made to achieve diversity in the legal profession.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Nonetheless, due in part to this Nation's long history of discrimination, minorities still have a disproportionately low level of participation in the legal profession. The result of such low participation is that a critical mass of racial minorities in the legal profession has not been reached. Reaching this critical mass requires educational pipelines of the sort created by race-conscious admissions programs like the University of Texas's program. Absent such pipelines, minority participation in higher education would dramatically decline, which would deplete diversity in the legal profession. As a result, there remains a compelling governmental interest in achieving and maintaining critical mass in the legal profession, and race-conscious admissions programs are a proper means to achieve that goal.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 To ensure the creation and maintenance of a critical mass of racial minorities in the legal profession, a pipeline must be maintained to allow qualified minorities the opportunity to earn admission to college and then law school and ultimately to enter the legal profession. When states have eliminated race-conscious admissions programs entirely,  \b \i0 \ul0 [**42]\b0 \i0 \ul0   the results have been disastrous. Without race-conscious admissions programs, racial minorities' college enrollment plummeted, and, by extension, minority law  \b \i0 \ul0 [*28]\b0 \i0 \ul0   school admissions fell dramatically. This resulted in a narrowing of the pipeline into the legal profession, which significantly reduced the number of racial minorities who became lawyers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In July of 1995, the Regents of the University of California adopted Resolution SP-1, which eliminated "race, religion, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin as criteria for admission" to the university system. n77 In November of 1996, California voters approved Proposition 209, which amended California's state constitution to prohibit the consideration of race, religion, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in admissions. n78

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 California's experience shows that eliminating race-conscious admissions programs for racial minorities has immediate and significant effects, reducing the number of people of color entering the legal profession. Without a robust pipeline, fewer racial minority candidates obtain access to college and, in turn, law school and the legal profession. This results in a lack of diversity in the legal profession. Thus, given the continuing need to foster diversity, there continues to be a compelling governmental interest in collegiate diversity as a means to further a pipeline to achieve diversity in the legal profession.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Diversity is of paramount importance in law schools because they "represent the training ground for a large number of the Nation's leaders" and "legal learning and practice . . . cannot be effective in isolation from the individuals and institutions with  \b \i0 \ul0 [*31]\b0 \i0 \ul0   which the law interacts.  \b \i0 \ul0 [**46]\b0 \i0 \ul0   " n84 Moreover, diversity strengthens the legal system as a whole: it ensures that numerous perspectives will be heard; it ensures that the legal system has legitimacy in the eyes of society; it increases access to legal representation for all; and it prepares our Nation's leaders. Diversity in the legal profession can only be fed by the flow of talented and qualified students through college and law school; and this pipeline is maintained, in part, by race-conscious college and law school admissions. Accordingly, race-conscious admissions programs remain a necessary and compelling governmental interest.
