\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 n1 Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 37.6, counsel for \b0 \i \ul0 amici curiae\b0 \i0 \ul0  state that no counsel for a party authored this brief in whole or in part, and that no person other than \b0 \i \ul0 amici curiae\b0 \i0 \ul0 , their members, or their counsel made a monetary contribution to the preparation or submission of this brief. The parties have filed blanket consent letters with the Clerk of the Court pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 37.3.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The NAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund, Inc. (LDF) is a non-profit legal organization that has participated in the litigation of this case from the outset, including twice presenting oral argument in the court of appeals. JA 7a, 16a; Pet. App. 262a, 264a. For more than seven decades, LDF has worked to dismantle racial segregation and ensure equal educational opportunity for all students. LDF has represented African-American students and applicants, as parties and \b0 \i \ul0 amici curiae\b0 \i0 \ul0 , in groundbreaking cases that seek to expand educational access and opportunity in higher education--both at UT, \b0 \i \ul0 see, e.g., \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Sweatt v. Painter\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 339 U.S. 629 (1950); \b0 \i \ul0 Hopwood v. Texas\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 78 F.3d 932 (5th Cir. 1996), and at other universities throughout the nation, \b0 \i \ul0 see, e.g., \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter v. Bollinger\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 539 U.S. 306 (2003); \b0 \i \ul0 Gratz v. Bollinger\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 539 U.S. 244 (2003); \b0 \i \ul0 United States v. Fordice\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 505 U.S. 717 (1992); \b0 \i \ul0 Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 438 U.S. 265 (1978); \b0 \i \ul0 Sipuel v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. of Okla\b0 \i0 \ul0 ., 332 U.S. 631 (1948); \b0 \i \ul0 Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 305 U.S. 337 (1938); \b0 \i \ul0 Adams v. Bell\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 711 F.2d 161 (D.C. Cir. 1983); Geier v. Bredesen, 453 F. Supp. 2d 1017 (M.D. Tenn. 2006). In addition, LDF's sixth President and Director-Counsel, the late John Payton, served as counsel to the University of Michigan in \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter\b0 \i0 \ul0  and \b0 \i \ul0 Gratz\b0 \i0 \ul0  and argued the latter case before this Court when he was in private practice prior to joining LDF.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 LDF represents the Black Student Alliance (ESA) at the University of Texas at Austin (UT), as well as the Black Ex-Students of Texas, Inc. (BEST), many of whose members were undergraduates during the period at issue in this case. Founded in 1980, the BSA serves as the leadership voice for African-American students at UT. BSA members have a strong interest in preserving UT's efforts to promote diversity through the inclusion of race as one of the many factors in UT's holistic review process. Although BSA recognizes that the campus is more inclusive than in the past, many of its members still expenence racial isolation in their classes, extracurricular activities, and other university settings because of the relatively few African-American students on campus.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 BEST, which was founded in 1998, brings together UT alumni to assist in recruiting, retaining, and supporting African-American students at UT. BEST also aims to increase awareness of the issues facing African-American students, faculty, and staff at UT, and provides networking opportunities for its alumni members. Many BEST members were students at UT between 1997 and 2004, the period when UT did not consider race in its admissions policies, and experienced significant racial isolation. All too often they were the only African-American student, or one of a very few, in their classes. Professors and fellow students frequently looked to BEST members to give the "Black perspective" on particular issues. Some also experienced acute incidents of racial hostility, which undermined their sense of belonging within the campus community. Accordingly, BEST members seek to promote an educational environment at UT in which African-American students no longer bear the crushing burden of tokenism and racial stereotype. LDF has represented BSA and BEST as \b0 \i \ul0 amici curiae\b0 \i0 \ul0  in this litigation since 2008 and 2012, respectively, and \b0 \i \ul0 amici\b0 \i0 \ul0  have a continued interest in protecting this Court's precedents affirming the importance of diversity in education.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360  \b \i0 \ul0 [*3]\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b \i0 \ul0 INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 "The enduring hope is that race should not matter; the reality is that too often it does." \b0 \i \ul0 Parents Involved in \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Cmty. Sch. v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 551 U.S. 701, 787 (2007) (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment). When, in 2012, this Court last heard this case, an increasingly popular misbelief that the United States was approaching, or had achieved, a colorblind society where race no longer had a meaningful impact on American life, had taken hold in this country. Since then, our nation has been confronted by a series of tragedies \b \i0 \ul0 [**8]\b0 \i0 \ul0   and upheavals that have put the stubborn persistence of racial bias, stereotype, and discrimination--as affirmed by the lived realities of many African--Americans-in stark relief.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 As our nation grapples with its long history of racial subordination and the continuing manifestations of racial bias in contemporary institutions, this Court once again faces the question of whether UT, the flagship university of this country's largest southern state, may--in its judgment--use race as one of several factors to achieve its overall goal of diversity.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The legal issues at stake have been substantially narrowed since the last time this case was before this Court, \b0 \i \ul0 Fisher v. Univ. of Tex. at Austin\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 133 S. Ct.  \b \i0 \ul0 [*4]\b0 \i0 \ul0   2411 (2013) ("\b0 \i \ul0 Fisher I\b0 \i0 \ul0 "). In \b0 \i \ul0 Fisher I\b0 \i0 \ul0 , the Court reaffirmed the principle that a diverse student body yields numerous educational benefits and is a compelling governmental interest. Thus, the sole question on remand to the Fifth Circuit was whether UT's use of race-conscious admissions is sufficiently narrowly tailored to further compelling governmental interests. As detailed in Respondents' Brief and the Fifth Circuit's decision, UT's admissions plan \b \i0 \ul0 [**9]\b0 \i0 \ul0   squarely satisfies these constitutional requirements.
\par \b0 \i \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Amici curiae\b0 \i0 \ul0  write separately to emphasize three important and determinative points. First, because Petitioner has acknowledged that she is not challenging \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter\b0 \i0 \ul0  and its progeny, she and her attorneys cannot use this case as a vehicle to fundamentally undermine this Court's longstanding precedents affirming the value of diversity in higher education. Furthermore, Petitioner faces significant, unresolved questions about her Article III standing. Under these circumstances, any effort by Petitioner to reexamine, recalibrate, or recast these precedents is particularly inappropriate given her highly-questionable Article III standing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Second, UT's present hybrid system of admissions is fully compliant with the letter and spirit of this Court's precedents. From 1997 to 2004, UT utilized a state law guaranteeing admission to all Texas residents ranked at the top of their high school graduating class as part of a "race-neutral" admissions system. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  Tex. Educ. Code Ann. \'a7 51.803 (West 1997) (amended 2015) (hereinafter the "Top Ten Percent Plan"). The shortfalls of this race-neutral experiment demonstrate why this Court \b \i0 \ul0 [**10]\b0 \i0 \ul0   should defer to UT's judgment that some measure of race-consciousness is necessary for it to attain a critical mass of students of color and to maintain flexibility  \b \i0 \ul0 [*5]\b0 \i0 \ul0   in defining the dimensions of the diversity that furthers its educational mission. Moreover, individual applicants' expression of race in the application process through personal essays affords due respect to their experiences, aspirations, and identity, as defined by the individual applicants themselves, that contribute to the diversity of the student body.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Third, Petitioner, having failed to secure relief, now seeks to reverse course and challenge settled questions about the meaning and merits of diversity. \b0 \i \ul0 Amici\b0 \i0 \ul0  are therefore compelled to reassert what the Court has long agreed is a compelling state interest: the myriad and essential benefits of a diverse student body for all students. The admission of a critical mass of diverse underrepresented students is crucial to combating bias, dispelling stereotypes, and enhancing mutual respect. Moreover, graduating a diverse class of students propagates the integration and inclusiveness of the broader community and fosters pathways to leadership in public life \b \i0 \ul0 [**11]\b0 \i0 \ul0   and other sectors of society for diverse individuals.
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 ARGUMENT\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 I. PETITIONER'S CASE OFFERS NO BASIS TO CHALLENGE THIS COURT'S PRECEDENTS AFFIRMING DIVERSITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION AS A COMPELLING GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST\b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Petitioner's case does not--and should not--provide any basis for reexamining this Court's longstanding and clearly established precedents recognizing the numerous educational benefits of diversity in higher education as a compelling governmental interest. In \b0 \i \ul0 Fisher I\b0 \i0 \ul0 , this Court reaffirmed the principle that  \b \i0 \ul0 [*6]\b0 \i0 \ul0   universities have a compelling interest in pursuing "the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body." 133 S. Ct. at 2417. The Court rightly embraced "as given" its prior precedent on this point. \b0 \i \ul0 Id\b0 \i0 \ul0 . (citing to \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 539 U.S. 306; \b0 \i \ul0 Gratz\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 539 U.S. 244; and \b0 \i \ul0 Bakke\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 438 U.S. 265).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Importantly, this Court's recognition of the educational benefits of diversity arose from a particular historical context in which UT played a distinctly significant and unfortunate role--namely, the \b0 \i \ul0 de jure\b0 \i0 \ul0  segregation of UT that affirmative action policies were originally \b \i0 \ul0 [**12]\b0 \i0 \ul0   created to remedy. The racial integration of UT Austin occurred slowly, even after this Court, in 1950, forced its law school to admit African-American students. \b0 \i \ul0 See \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Sweatt\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 339 U.S. 629. In the 1970s, the federal government undertook a court-ordered investigation of Texas's higher education system and found that the state had failed to eliminate vestiges of its formerly segregated system. \b0 \i \ul0 See \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Hopwood v. Texas\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 861 F. Supp. 551, 554 (W.D. Tex. 1994) (chronicling this investigation and Texas's subsequent efforts to come into compliance), \b0 \i \ul0 rev'd on other grounds\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 78 F.3d 932 (5th Cir. 1996). In 2000, Texas and the federal government entered into an ongoing agreement designed to address the persistence of racial segregation in Texas's higher education system. n2 Thus, "[d]iscrimination against blacks in the state system of higher education is well  \b \i0 \ul0 [*7]\b0 \i0 \ul0   documented in history books, case law, and the State's legislative history." \b0 \i \ul0 Hopwood\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 861 F. Supp. at 554. And UT has admitted that it is "painfully aware" that, notwithstanding these efforts, in the six decades following this Court's decision in \b0 \i \ul0 Sweatt\b0 \i0 \ul0 , "vestiges \b \i0 \ul0 [**13]\b0 \i0 \ul0   of \b0 \i \ul0 de jure\b0 \i0 \ul0  segregation" persist. Resp. Br. 4 (citing SJA 14a and \b0 \i \ul0 Sweatt\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 339 U.S. 629). n3

\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n3 Given this extensive history, the race-conscious component of UT's admissions process also constitutes a constitutionally justifiable remedial measure for past and present discrimination. \b0 \i \ul0 See \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Fordice\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 505 U.S. at 729 ("If policies traceable to the \b0 \i \ul0 de jure\b0 \i0 \ul0  system are still in force and have \b \i0 \ul0 discriminatory effects, those policies too must be reformed");\b0 \i0 \ul0  \b0 \i \ul0 Veasey v.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In light of this history, this Court has repeatedly reaffirmed the validity of the government's compelling interest in student diversity for good reason: "[N]othing less than the 'nation's future depends upon leaders trained through wide exposure to the ideas and mores of students as diverse as this Nation of many peoples.'" \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 539 U.S. at 324 (quoting \b0 \i \ul0 Bakke\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 438 U.S. at 313).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 States and universities across the nation have also repeatedly acknowledged that critical educational benefits flow from diverse campuses and classrooms. \b0 \i \ul0 See generally\b0 \i0 \ul0  Amicus Br. of Massachusetts et al.; Amicus Br. of Leading Public Research Universities. These benefits are as pertinent today as they were when Justice Powell cast the deciding vote in \b0 \i \ul0 Bakke\b0 \i0 \ul0  more than three decades ago, when this Court decided \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter\b0 \i0 \ul0  twelve years ago, and when it reaffirmed \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter's\b0 \i0 \ul0  key principles in \b0 \i \ul0 Fisher I\b0 \i0 \ul0  two years ago.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360  \b \i0 \ul0 [*8]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Petitioner has previously acknowledged and now assumes \b0 \i \ul0 arguendo\b0 \i0 \ul0 , Pet. Br. 22, that "the interest in the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body" is a constitutionally permissible government compelling interest \b \i0 \ul0 [**15]\b0 \i0 \ul0   for a university, \b0 \i \ul0 Fisher I\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 133 S. Ct. at 2413 (quoting \b0 \i \ul0 Bakke\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 438 U.S. at 299 (opinion of Powell, J.)). Indeed, Petitioner has expressly and "very carefully [said that she was] not trying to change the Comt's disposition of the issue in \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter\b0 \i0 \ul0 " or the "legitimacy of the interest" in diversity, \b0 \i \ul0 Fisher I\b0 \i0 \ul0 , Tr. of Oral Arg. at 8. Notwithstanding these clear and unequivocal concessions in \b0 \i \ul0 Fisher I\b0 \i0 \ul0 , and in light of the failure of her challenge, Petitioner now attempts to relitigate \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter\b0 \i0 \ul0 , relitigate \b0 \i \ul0 Fisher I\b0 \i0 \ul0 , and challenge the contours and core of the government's compelling interest in racial diversity. Pet. Br. 3, 20, 21, 26, 29, 30, 33. But Fisher should not be given a second bite at the apple -- let alone a third or more.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Indeed, Petitioner's attempts to excavate and re-examine settled law are particularly inappropriate given the fundamental questions about her standing that remain unresolved. Fisher's claims, even if they were properly before this Court, are not redressable. \b0 \i \ul0 See generally\b0 \i0 \ul0  Resp. Br. Because Petitioner did not litigate her case on behalf of a class and she graduated from another university in 2012, her forward-looking \b \i0 \ul0 [**16]\b0 \i0 \ul0   demands for an injunction and declaratory judgment have fallen away. \b0 \i \ul0 Cf. \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 DeFunis v. Odegaard\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 416 U.S. 312, 319 (1974) (per curiam). Thus, the only relief Petitioner now seeks is "monetary damages in the form of refund of application fees." JA 89a. However, Fisher has no standing to pursue this relief because UT's allegedly unconstitutional conduct did not cause her to pay the application fee in the first place. Nor would a refund  \b \i0 \ul0 [*9]\b0 \i0 \ul0   redress her alleged injury resulting from the University's purported failure to treat her application fairly. \b0 \i \ul0 See \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 523 U.S. 83, 107 (1998) ("Relief that does not remedy the injury suffered cannot bootstrap a plaintiff into federal court; that is the very essence of the redressability requirement."). Indeed, Fisher conceded in her complaint that, insofar as she was unconstitutionally "deprived of the opportunity to attend the UT Austin," that is "an injury that cannot be redressed by money damages." JA 119a. n4

\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 n4 Fisher's complaint also requested attorney's fees and costs, but that demand cannot on its own establish an Article III case or controversy. \b0 \i \ul0 See \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Lewis v. Cont'l Bank Corp\b0 \i0 \ul0 ., 494 U.S. 472, 480 (1990). Moreover, since Petitioner would not have been admitted to UT, even with a different admissions policy or a "perfect" score on certain achievement indices, Petitioner has not suffered any cognizable injury. JA 465a-66a; \b0 \i \ul0 see also \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Fisher v. Univ. of Tex. at Austin\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 758 F.3d 633, 639 & n.17 (5th Cir. 2014) (no Fall 2008 applicants were admitted with Fisher's achievement index score). This fact is fatal to Fisher"s claim under \b0 \i \ul0 Texas v. Lesage\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 528 U.S. 18, 21 (1999) (per curiam).

Leaving Fisher's standing deficiencies unaddressed suggests that these requirements need not be thoroughly satisfied when plaintiffs claim that their rights have been violated for the alleged benefit of racial minorities. Turning a blind eye to these important jurisdictional questions defies principles of judicial restraint and raises serious questions about the fair and consistent application of the standing doctrine by this Court. n7

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The only question properly before this Court is whether UT's admissions policy is narrowly tailored. This inquiry assesses the \b0 \i \ul0 means\b0 \i0 \ul0  used by UT to achieve the benefits of diversity in education.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 History and practice amply demonstrate that UT justifiably determined that it needed to increase diversity beyond that which it had achieved between 1997 and 2004, under an ostensibly "race-neutral" system. Today, UT's hybrid system of admissions remains fully compliant with the letter and spirit of this Court's precedents.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360  \b \i0 \ul0 [*11]\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b \i0 \ul0 A. History\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b \i0 \ul0 [**19]\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b \i0 \ul0  amply demonstrates that race-conscious holistic review is a necessary supplement to the Top Ten Percent Plan to achieve a broadly diverse student body\b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \b0 \i \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Fisher I\b0 \i0 \ul0  reiterated that narrow tailoring requires "careful judicial inquiry" and assigns to universities the "ultimate burden" of demonstrating the inadequacy of race-neutral alternatives. 133 S. Ct. at 2420. When admonishing that "[s]trict scrutiny must not be strict in theory, but fatal in fact," this Court recognized that there is some latitude as to \b0 \i \ul0 how\b0 \i0 \ul0  a university can make its required showing. \b0 \i \ul0 Id\b0 \i0 \ul0 . at 2421.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 UT could have addressed the insufficiency of its race-neutral alternatives to achieving the benefits of diversity in any number of ways. Here, UT analyzed the data and results from its actual implementation of a race-neutral process, carefully determined that those measures remained inadequate, and developed an admissions policy that gave it the flexibility to address those inadequacies. This Court should give UT due latitude in constructing its admissions policy after having tried so assiduously to use race-neutral alternatives. UT should not be penalized with the imposition of \b \i0 \ul0 [**20]\b0 \i0 \ul0   an impossibly exacting standard that is effectively "fatal in fact."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 UT extensively experimented with race-neutral measures from 1997 to 2004, when a ban on race-conscious admissions was in place as a result of the Fifth Circuit's decision in \b0 \i \ul0 Hopwood\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 78 F.3d 932. As part of this effort, UT expanded outreach and scholarships, took full advantage of the state law establishing the Top Ten Percent Plan, and instituted individualized review for applicants not admitted through that plan. \b0 \i \ul0 See \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Fisher v. Univ. of Tex. at\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b \i0 \ul0 [*12]\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b0 \i \ul0 Austin\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 645 F. Supp. 2d 587, 591 (W.D. Tex. 2009), \b0 \i \ul0 aff'd\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 631 F.3d 213 (5th Cir. 2011). That individualized review included the socio-economic status of applicants' families, extracurricular activities, community service, leadership qualities, and multiple other factors--but it did not consider race. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  JA 97a-105a.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The race-neutral admissions process failed to achieve UT's desired level of campus diversity to serve its educational goals. In assessing whether it was providing the necessary exposure to different viewpoints to achieve the educational benefits of student diversity, UT appropriately considered \b \i0 \ul0 [**21]\b0 \i0 \ul0   the very low number of African-American students who matriculated between 1997 and 2004. In that seven-year time period following \b0 \i \ul0 Hopwood\b0 \i0 \ul0 , n8 an average of 7,000 first-year students enrolled at UT each year, and no more than 309 of those enrolled students per year were African Americans. JA 177a. In addition, the percentage of African-American students admitted through the Top Ten Percent Plan dropped and then stagnated at 3-4%. \b0 \i \ul0 Fisher\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 758 F.3d at 649. At no point between 1997 and 2004 did African-Americans constitute more than 5% of any first-year class. \b0 \i \ul0 Id\b0 \i0 \ul0 .

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Further, the low enrollment numbers of African-American students \b \i0 \ul0 [**22]\b0 \i0 \ul0   exacerbated the substantial racial isolation experienced by the students of color who attended UT in the \b0 \i \ul0 post-Hopwood, pre-Grutter\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b \i0 \ul0 [*13]\b0 \i0 \ul0   period. During this period of low-minority enrollment incidents of racial hostility on campus sparked student protests and prompted UT to convene a Task Force on Racial Respect and Fairness in March 2003. The Task Force's January 2004 report was produced while the University's post-\b0 \i \ul0 Grutter\b0 \i0 \ul0  review of its admissions policies was still pending. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  Univ. of Tex. at Austin, \b0 \i \ul0 Report of the Task Force on Racial Respect and Fairness\b0 \i0 \ul0 , at 3 (2004). This review of racial hostility and racial isolation informed UTs conclusion that the race neutral admissions process failed to ensure that UT's students received the educational benefits of diversity.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Because the facially race-neutral measures failed to achieve sufficient diversity, UT adopted the hybrid process now at issue, which combines the race-neutral Top Ten Percent Plan (whereby over 75% of UT students are admitted each year--80% during the relevant time period here) and the race-conscious holistic review process (under which the remainder of the class is admitted). Such limited consideration \b \i0 \ul0 [**23]\b0 \i0 \ul0   of enrollment levels is acceptable in a university's critical mass n9 inquiry. As this Court has explained, "'some attention to numbers,' without-more, does not transform a flexible admissions system into a rigid quota." \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 539 U.S. at 336 (quoting \b0 \i \ul0 Bakke\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 438 U.S. at 323 (appendix to opinion of Powell, J.))

\par \fs20 \pard 
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Petitioner's contention "that UT effectively achieved critical mass no later than 2003, the last  \b \i0 \ul0 [*14]\b0 \i0 \ul0   year it employed its race neutral admissions plan," Pet. Br. 46, is belied by the undisputed record: "When the holistic review program was modified to be race-conscious, 90% of classes had one or zero African-American students,  \b \i0 \ul0 [**24]\b0 \i0 \ul0   46% had one or zero Asian-American students, and 43% had one or zero Hispanic students." \b0 \i \ul0 Fisher\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 758 F. 3d at 658. And, despite Petitioner's claims to the contrary, \b0 \i \ul0 cf\b0 \i0 \ul0 . Pet. Br. 46, the adoption of race-conscious holistic review significantly increased the enrollment of African-American and other underrepresented minority students at UT, thus becoming an essential supplement to the Top Ten Percent Plan and other race-neutral efforts. n10 
\par \pard 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n10 Even if Petitioner were correct that UT's race-conscious admissions policy is unnecessary to achieve a critical mass of students of color, the policy would still pass constitutional muster. \b0 \i \ul0 Cf\b0 \i0 \ul0 . Pet. Br. 45-46. Although \b0 \i \ul0 Parents Involved\b0 \i0 \ul0  questioned the necessity of a K-12 student assignment plan that had minimal statistical impact, the plan in that case had rigid, binary racial classifications that could be "determinative standing alone." 551 U.S. at 723; Pet. App. 310a-311a. Thus, \b0 \i \ul0 Parents Involved\b0 \i0 \ul0  distinguished that rigid type of student assignment plan from the individualized review, at issue in \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter\b0 \i0 \ul0  and here, where race is considered "as part of a broader effort to achieve 'exposure to widely diverse people, cultures, ideas, and viewpoints.'" 551 U.S. at 723 (quoting \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 539 U.S. at 330); \b0 \i \ul0 see also id\b0 \i0 \ul0 . at 793 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment).

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 For example, in the incoming freshman class for the 2008-2009 year (the class to which Fisher applied), total African-American enrollment increased by 21.4%, as compared to the incoming freshman class for the 2004-2005 school year (the last class admitted exclusively through race-neutral admissions). Moreover, in the first four entering classes after UT's 2004 decision to use race-conscious admissions, 435  \b \i0 \ul0 [*15]\b0 \i0 \ul0   out of the total of 1,544 African-American students--a full 28%-were admitted through the holistic admissions program. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  SJA 156a-157a. While the race-conscious component of the admission program is "modest" in its approach, \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 539 U.S. at 393 (Kennedy, J., dissenting), its impact is substantial in achieving its diversity goals.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 UT "does not suggest that the end point . . . is a specific measure of diversity in every class," \b0 \i \ul0 Fisher\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 758 F. 3d at 658, but research confirms that increases in the enrollment of African-American students, even on a small scale, have a multiplier effect. A study of selective universities found that even "a one percentage point increase in the share of []students [of color] in the entering freshman \b \i0 \ul0 [**26]\b0 \i0 \ul0   cohort is associated with a 3 or 4 percent increase in the odds of interacting with students of different racial backgrounds." Thomas J. Espenshade & Alexandria Walton Radford, \b0 \i \ul0 No Longer Separate, Not Yet Equal: Race and Class in Elite College Admission and Campus Life\b0 \i0 \ul0  199 (2009).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Overall, this history of experimentation, revision, and improvement demonstrates how UT extensively explored race-neutral alternatives, rigorously determined they were inadequate alone, and carefully crafted narrow race--conscious supplementaTy measures. Moreover, the comparatively slim and individualized consideration of race here-as just one factor among many--should itself inform this Court's narrow tailoring analysis, because it speaks directly to the specificity with which UT has formulated a remedy and sought to fulfill its goals. Together, these circumstances more than suffice to satisfy the strictures of narrow tailoring.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360  \b \i0 \ul0 [*16]\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b \i0 \ul0 B. Overhauling UT's policy would distort established precedent and impair UT's ability to carry out its educational mission\b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Petitioner seeks drastic changes to UT's admissions system that would upend this Court's longstanding precedents and UT's commendable \b \i0 \ul0 [**27]\b0 \i0 \ul0   efforts to achieve diversity in several detrimental ways.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 First, Petitioner astoundingly criticizes UT for \b0 \i \ul0 not\b0 \i0 \ul0  choosing a "specific or approximate level of minority admissions," Pet. Br. 8. This argument fundamentally misconceives of critical mass and comes perilously close to contravening this Court's prohibition on racial quotas. \b0 \i \ul0 See supra\b0 \i0 \ul0  n.9. Indeed, it would create a constitutional Catch-22 to require UT to undertake a highly individualized admissions process and then fault it for not specifying categorical racial targets or goals.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Second, Petitioner's race-blind alternative, Pet. Br. 26-30, would cap enrollment of underrepresented minority students at the level achieved prior to \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter\b0 \i0 \ul0 . That is impractical and problematic for many of the reasons UT cataloged in recent years. \b0 \i \ul0 See supra\b0 \i0 \ul0  Section II.A. Moreover, this unduly rigid understanding of critical mass is inconsistent with this Court's pronouncements and would severely impair UT's ability to advance "vital component[s] of its educational mission," \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 539 U.S. at 340.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Third, Petitioner would elevate the numerical presence of minorities over the substantive value of viewpoint diversity.  \b \i0 \ul0 [**28]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Currently, UT's educational goal of attaining a broadly diverse student body depends on the understanding that minority students cannot and should not be required to express some stereotypical minority viewpoint on any issue.  \b \i0 \ul0 [*17]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Individualized race-conscious review helps to overcome the stereotypes that all students of any given race think alike. As explained in Section III.B, \b0 \i \ul0 infra\b0 \i0 \ul0 , the presence of different types of students of various races, with unique perspectives and viewpoints, is the hallmark of UT's push for broader diversity. Petitioner's emphasis on the value of "race-neutral" processes impermissibly assumes that minority students always embody a certain perspective that will be attained by simply enrolling a certain number of racially diverse students. This ignores the value of the diversity of viewpoints, and experiences within racial groups, and thereby distorts this Court's holdings from \b0 \i \ul0 Bakke\b0 \i0 \ul0  onwards.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Fourth, Petitioner's desire to overhaul UT's admissions policy is ill-suited for other colleges and contexts. This Court previously recognized that a percentage plan may "not [be] a workable alternative . . . 'in a constitutionally significant sense'"  \b \i0 \ul0 [**29]\b0 \i0 \ul0   since such plans "may preclude the university from conducting the individualized assessments necessary to assemble a student body that is not just racially diverse, but diverse along all the qualities valued by the university." \b0 \i \ul0 Fisher v. Univ. of Tex. at Austin\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 631 F.3d 213, 239 (5th Cir. 2011) (quoting \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 539 U.S. at 340); UT Supp. Br. 31-34 (Fifth Circuit, Oct. 25, 2013). Other schools have similarly found Top Ten Percent style-plans are not workable alternatives to race-conscious holistic review processes. \b0 \i \ul0 See generally\b0 \i0 \ul0  Amicus Br. of Dean Robert Post and Dean Martha Minow. If Petitioner's drastic remedy were applied nationally, there would be a significant drop in minority enrollment, with predictably grim consequences for achieving the educational benefits of diversity and for diversity within professional trajectories and leadership  \b \i0 \ul0 [*18]\b0 \i0 \ul0   development. \b0 \i \ul0 See infra\b0 \i0 \ul0  Section III.C; \b0 \i \ul0 see e.g\b0 \i0 \ul0 ., Jessica S. Howell, \b0 \i \ul0 Assessing the Impact of Eliminating Affirmative Action in Higher Education\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 28 J. Labor Econ. 113, 116 (2010) (finding that African-American and Latino enrollment at selective universities would decline 10.2% if race-neutral \b \i0 \ul0 [**30]\b0 \i0 \ul0   admissions were mandated nationwide).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Finally, we note that Petitioner's proposal would eliminate the gains that UT has already made, when, in reality, notwithstanding promising increases in African-American enrollment, UT is still working to achieve a critical mass. The representation of minority students is still at \b0 \i \ul0 de minimis\b0 \i0 \ul0  levels in too many settings on campus. For example, African-American male students still account for a mere 1.8% of UT student enrollment. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  Jasmine Johnson, \b0 \i \ul0 For Black Male Students at UT-Austin, Data Tells Different Story about Diversity\b0 \i0 \ul0 , Daily Texan, Nov. 25, 2013. Perhaps not surprisingly, current African-American students who are members of \b0 \i \ul0 amici curiae\b0 \i0 \ul0  BSA and BEST have reported that they frequently feel singled out and misunderstood. Some students have had \b0 \i \ul0 to\b0 \i0 \ul0  grapple with others on campus assuming that they sell drugs. Others have often felt as though they were the only Black male student in a given major. While UT may have taken strides to create a more welcoming and inclusive campus climate, \b0 \i \ul0 amici curiae\b0 \i0 \ul0  experience continuing racial hostility n11 and a sense of racial isolation in the classroom.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Thus, contrary to Petitioner's claim that critical mass had been or can be achieved through the Top Ten Percent Plan, \b0 \i \ul0 amici curiae\b0 \i0 \ul0  firmly believe that--consistent with \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter\b0 \i0 \ul0 --UT can and must do more,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*20]\b0 \i0 \ul0   not less, to ensure that all students fully attain the educational benefits of diversity.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Under UT's hybrid policy, one race-conscious component of the admissions process is the personal statement or open-ended application essay, JA 467a, in which students share the most important and individual aspects of themselves, such as their aspirations, formative experiences, or adversities they might have overcome. This is a near-universal requirement of college applications throughout the nation, \b0 \i \ul0 see, e.g\b0 \i0 \ul0 ., The Common Application, Writing Requirements for the Common App, https://www.commonapp.org/whats-appening/application-updates/writing-requirements-common-app. While the focus in this case has been on the consideration of race in a "checkbox," any determination by this Court that race cannot be a component of UT's admissions procedures could potentially have the disastrous effect of limiting or prohibiting discussions of personal racial identity in the essay portion of the application, and in other parts of the application process.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Rejecting or otherwise negatively evaluating applicants merely because they touch upon, reveal, or discuss personal racial identity in the admissions process demeans the respect and individualized treatment that \b \i0 \ul0 [**33]\b0 \i0 \ul0   every prospective student is owed. Yet, Petitioner seeks exactly that: admissions policies that consider \b0 \i \ul0 every\b0 \i0 \ul0  aspect of students' experience, background, and identity, \b0 \i \ul0 except for their race\b0 \i0 \ul0 . Taken to its logical conclusion, Petitioner's proposed race-blind holistic review process would require  \b \i0 \ul0 [*21]\b0 \i0 \ul0   admissions officials to scrub all references to personal racial identity from students' application files, including their essays, thereby resulting in "a form of viewpoint discrimination." \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  Gerald Torres, Fisher v.

Others share stories of adversity or accomplishment that touch upon subjects other than racial identity: e.g., serving in the military or being gay or lesbian.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Singling out race for exclusion contradicts \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter\b0 \i0 \ul0 's requirement that a university's individualized review  \b \i0 \ul0 [*22]\b0 \i0 \ul0   be "flexible enough to consider all pertinent elements of diversity[,]" 539 U.S. at 337 (quoting \b0 \i \ul0 Bakke\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 438 U.S. at 318) (opinion of Powell, J.)), and forces universities like UT "to become . . . much different institution[s] and sacrifice . . .  \b \i0 \ul0 [**35]\b0 \i0 \ul0   vital component[s] of [their] educational mission." \b0 \i \ul0 Id\b0 \i0 \ul0 . at 340. Moreover, constricting applicants' reference to their race sends a message to minority students that a critical element of their identity is irrelevant or worse, unwelcome.

A critical mass of students of color is necessary because, "[b]y virtue of our Nation's struggle with  \b \i0 \ul0 [*24]\b0 \i0 \ul0   racial inequality, such students are both likely to have experiences of particular importance to [a university's] mission, and less likely to be admitted in meaningful numbers [based] on criteria \b \i0 \ul0 [**38]\b0 \i0 \ul0   that ignore those experiences." \b0 \i \ul0 Id\b0 \i0 \ul0 . at 338.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360  \b \i0 \ul0 [*25]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Second, attaining a critical mass of minority students at a given university is necessary to counter the underlying patterns of residential segregation that limit racial integration at the K-12 level. This Court recently recognized that the "vestiges [of \b0 \i \ul0 de jure\b0 \i0 \ul0  residential segregation] remain today, intertwined with the country's economic and social life." \b0 \i \ul0 Id\b0 \i0 \ul0 . at 2515.

Absent critical mass, these national patterns of residential segregation, and their impact on K-12 education, facilitate racial stereotyping. Specifically, students are likely to come to college from schools where they were "surrounded only by the likes of themselves," and, therefore, have perspectives that are limited by these formative experiences. \b0 \i \ul0 Bakke\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 438 U.S. at 312 n.48 (opinion of Powell, J.) (citation omitted). These facts are plainly relevant here because, as UT acknowledges, the "vestiges of \b0 \i \ul0 de jure\b0 \i0 \ul0  segregation" persist and "the Texas school system remains largely segregated," Resp. Br. 4, 7.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Third, a critical mass ensures that underrepresented minority students are not unfairly regarded as "spokespersons for their race." \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 539 U.S. at 319-20. Meaningful representation of underrepresented minorities ensures that "nonminority students learn there is no minority viewpoint but rather a variety of viewpoints among minority students." \b0 \i \ul0 Id\b0 \i0 \ul0 . (internal quotation marks and citation \b \i0 \ul0 [**41]\b0 \i0 \ul0   omitted). Critical mass also reduces the likelihood that minority students will feel isolated or limited by what may be perceived as their token  \b \i0 \ul0 [*26]\b0 \i0 \ul0   status. And in such circumstances, "nonminority students learn there is no minority viewpoint but rather a variety of viewpoints among minority students." \b0 \i \ul0 Id\b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Finally, although this fact is frequently overlooked, courts have long recognized that \b0 \i \ul0 all\b0 \i0 \ul0  students, regardless of their race, benefit from the presence of a critical mass of underrepresented students. \b0 \i \ul0 See, e.g., \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Fisher\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 768 F. 3d at 660 (recognizing this effect at UT). As far back as the \b0 \i \ul0 Brown v. Board of Education\b0 \i0 \ul0  case, LDF presented evidence demonstrating that segregation hurts not just racial minorities but also majority groups. \b0 \i \ul0 See The Effect of Segregation and the Consequences of Desegregation: A Social Science Statement, reprinted in\b0 \i0 \ul0  37 Minn. L. Rev. 427 (1953) (appendix to appellants' briefs) (hereinafter, "Social Scientists Statement"). n15 \b0 \i \ul0 See also \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Wright v.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Petitioner asserts that "intra-racial diversity" is an improperly-raised, "post-hoc" justification for race-conscious admissions by UT that has no basis in this Court's precedent. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  Pet. Br. at 30-35. This contention is wrong for several reasons.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 First, while the precise phrasing has changed, the concept of "diversity within diversity"--or intra-racial diversity--is firmly rooted in this Court's precedents upholding narrowly-tailored race-conscious admissions policies. \b0 \i \ul0 See \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Bakke\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 438 U.S. at 315 ("The diversity that furthers a compelling state interest encompasses a far broader array of qualifications and characteristics of which racial or ethnic origin is but a single though important element."). This Court has long recognized that institutions of higher education  \b \i0 \ul0 [*28]\b0 \i0 \ul0   have a compelling interest in assembling diverse student bodies not only across racial lines, but also "along all the qualities valued by the University." \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 539 U.S. at 340. Justice Powell recognized \b \i0 \ul0 [**44]\b0 \i0 \ul0   in \b0 \i \ul0 Bakke\b0 \i0 \ul0  that university admissions programs could consider "the variety of points of view, backgrounds and experiences of blacks in the United States." 438 U.S. at 323 (appendix to opinion of Powell, J.). Indeed, the concept of diversity within diversity was introduced by this Court long before the concept of "critical mass." \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 539 U.S. at 335-36. \b0 \i \ul0 See also\b0 \i0 \ul0  Akhil Reed Amar & Neal Kumar Katyal, \b0 \i \ul0 Bakke's Fate\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 43 UCLA L. Rev. 1745, 1763 n.87 (1996) ("Justice Powell's \b0 \i \ul0 Bakke\b0 \i0 \ul0  Appendix pointedly quoted Harvard's recognition of the importance of intra-as well as inter-racial diversity.") (citation omitted).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Second, in light of this clear law, UT's critical mass inquiry can and should consider the rich diversity within and among underrepresented minority groups. UT's current, multi-faceted admissions process meets this goal by properly ensuring consideration of factors beyond high school rank so that it is able to "assembl[e] a class that is both exceptionally academically qualified and broadly diverse," \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 539 U.S. at 329. Because the Top Ten Percent Plan, on the other hand, considered the single rigid \b \i0 \ul0 [**45]\b0 \i0 \ul0   measure, class rank, it excluded students with richly varied qualifications that cannot be captured by grades and class standing. Academically qualified and broadly diverse students who may not meet the top ten percent requirements could include intellectually adventurous students who enroll in demanding classes outside of their comfort zones rather than playing it safe to preserve their class rank; prodigies who achieve excellence in non-academic fields; backyard entrepreneurs who have  \b \i0 \ul0 [*29]\b0 \i0 \ul0   less academic success but are demonstrated leaders and risk-takers; or late bloomers who mature into their academic potential over time. These sorts of valuable experiences and qualities create a richly textured diversity within diversity that would be overlooked in a mechanical admissions program like the Top Ten Percent Plan. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  Gurin et al., \b0 \i \ul0 Diversity and Higher Education\b0 \i0 \ul0 , at 360 (outlining research on diversity that "demonstrates the significant impact of interactions with diverse peers" and its "critical importance [to students'] personal development").
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Third, because UT proactively recruits students of all races from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds, Petitioner's \b \i0 \ul0 [**46]\b0 \i0 \ul0   claim that UT's reliance on diversity within diversity serves only to identify affluent students from integrated, suburban schools is patently false. Fisher Supp. Br. 47-48 (Fifth Circuit, Oct. 4, 2013). Several variables in UT's holistic review take into account socio-economic status. JA 162a-63a, 197a-98a. Thus, UT's admissions process does not favor students from any particular background, racial or otherwise; instead, its individualized holistic review promotes diversity-including intra-racial diversity -- by admitting racially diverse students from diverse backgrounds of all kinds.
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 C. A diverse graduating class opens pathways to leadership and fosters public confidence and trust in educational institutions\b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 On-campus diversity is critical to a robust educational environment. It is also essential to creating a diverse pipeline of students who, after graduation, populate the echelons of the government, military, private sector, and civil society. For this reason, it is important for "[a]ll members of our  \b \i0 \ul0 [*30]\b0 \i0 \ul0   heterogeneous society [to] have confidence in the openness and integrity of the educational institutions that provide this training." \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 539 U.S. at 332. \b \i0 \ul0 [**47]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Indeed, in \b0 \i \ul0 Sweatt\b0 \i0 \ul0 , this Court struck down UT Law School's policy of racial segregation based, in part, on its recognition that a law school "cannot be effective in isolation from the individuals and institutions with which the law interacts." \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 539 U.S. at 332 (quoting \b0 \i \ul0 Sweatt\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 339 U.S. at 634).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 It is for these reasons that here, and in \b0 \i \ul0 Fisher I\b0 \i0 \ul0 , a broad array of \b0 \i \ul0 amici curiae\b0 \i0 \ul0  have submitted briefs to this Court detailing the many ways in which diversity in higher education benefits all aspects of society. \b0 \i \ul0 See generally\b0 \i0 \ul0  Amicus Br. of Fortune-100 and Other Leading American Businesses; Amicus Br. of Lt. Gen. Julius Becton, et al.; Amicus Br. of Association of American Medical Colleges, et al.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 A diverse graduating class is particularly vital for large public universities like UT, whose graduates overwhelmingly fill the ranks of state legislatures and judiciaries. Indeed, UT alumni have gone on to become formidable leaders in Texas and across the nation in a wide variety of fields, including federal, state, and local governments, the private sector, and civil society. \b0 \i \ul0 See e.g., Fisher I\b0 \i0 \ul0 , Amicus Br. of Distinguished Alumni, at \b \i0 \ul0 [**48]\b0 \i0 \ul0   5. Given this critical leadership development function, it is sensible and desirable that UT seek to bring together potential leaders from different backgrounds, races, and parts of the state and the world.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 It is particularly crucial for UT to pursue diversity because, as detailed in Section I, \b0 \i \ul0 supra\b0 \i0 \ul0 , and acknowledged by UT, Resp. Br. 4, African-Americans were excluded from UT for much of its history-first by law and then in effect. And, more recently, before it adopted race-conscious admissions, \b0 \i \ul0 see\b0 \i0 \ul0  Section II.A  \b \i0 \ul0 [*31]\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b0 \i \ul0 supra\b0 \i0 \ul0 , UT had a "less-than-realistic environment" that was "not conducive to training the leaders of tomorrow," SJA 24a-25a, because of the significant disparities between the numbers of African-Americans students at UT, and the number of African Americans in Texas and of African Americans in the populations of Texas's high schools, \b0 \i \ul0 Fisher I\b0 \i0 \ul0 , Pet. App. 273a; JA 177a; SJA 3a. n17 UT recognizes that "[p]ublic confidence is the only real endowment of a state university." n18 Thus, UT's efforts to develop a pipeline of diverse leaders serve the broader community, and bolster the public's trust in the organizations and institutions that \b \i0 \ul0 [**49]\b0 \i0 \ul0   they populate.

\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n17 This legitimate concern about significant racial disparities does not in any way suggest--as Petitioner claims--that UT's pursuit of critical mass was designed to achieve "demographic proportionality." Pet. Br. 44. Rather, some degree of attention to the surrounding community is required, since "[a] university presenting itself as open to all may be challenged when the state's minority population grows steadily but minority enrollment does not," as has been the case in Texas. Pet. App. 196a. UT's consideration of such demographics arose only when it "first studied whether a race-conscious admissions program was needed to attain critical mass," and not "as part of any individual admissions decision."

A statement submitted by social scientists in \b0 \i \ul0 Brown v. Board\b0 \i0 \ul0  noted that segregated students "like all other  \b \i0 \ul0 [*32]\b0 \i0 \ul0   human beings [] require a sense of personal dignity" and yet "almost nowhere in the larger society do they find their own dignity as human beings respected by others." Social Scientists Statement, \b0 \i \ul0 supra\b0 \i0 \ul0 . Likewise, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., observed that the "founding fathers were really influenced" by the theological precept that all humans have "a uniqueness . . . [and a God-given sense of] dignity." Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Address at the Ebenezer Baptist Church, The American Dream (July 4, 1965). That tenet rightly has continued to guide this Court's jurisprudence in recent years. \b0 \i \ul0 See e.g., \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Obergefell v. Hodges\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 135 S. Ct. 2584, 2608 (2015) ("[Petitioners] ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right."); \b0 \i \ul0 United States v. Windsor\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 133 S. Ct. 2675, 2689 (2013) (Equal Protection principles apply to lesbian and gay couples who "aspire to occupy \b \i0 \ul0 [**51]\b0 \i0 \ul0   the same status and dignity as that of a man and woman in lawful marriage."); \b0 \i \ul0 Lawrence v. Texas\b0 \i0 \ul0 , 539 U.S. 558, 574 (2003) ("At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.").
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The right to define one's own concept of existence is null if a salient aspect of that existence is relegated to oblivion by judicial fiat. Prospective students would be forced to cloak their differences and suppress their life-experiences to hide the personal racial identity that is intrinsic to who they are. In the end, Petitioner's proposal to eliminate race from the individualized review process, if accepted, would require racial closeting. A decision finding UT's admissions policy unconstitutional would send an unmistakable message at a crucial and sensitive moment for our nation's progress: universities, consider any experience an applicant may share, but  \b \i0 \ul0 [*33]\b0 \i0 \ul0   just not her race; administrators, retreat from your modest advances to reap the benefits of diversity; students, do not share your identity, because it is irrelevant or even unwelcome. The Court must not and need not pursue such a \b \i0 \ul0 [**52]\b0 \i0 \ul0   perilous path.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 As this Court has wisely chosen to do before, it should instead adhere to existing precedent and affirm the validity of UT's narrowly tailored, holistic review process. For the foregoing reasons, the Court should affirm the judgment of the Fifth Circuit.
