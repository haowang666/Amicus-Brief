\par \pard 
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Respondent University of Texas at Austin ("UT") appropriately sought to obtain the benefits of a diverse student body through narrowly tailored means that are consistent with the strict parameters of the Fourteenth Amendment. Petitioner seeks to upend the era of peace in higher education admissions and demands that this Court restrict, if not overturn, UT's judgment to consider race as one of many factors used in its holistic, individualized review of applications. This Court should decline that invitation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Before determining that it lacked a level of student diversity that would fulfill its mission, UT engaged in an extensive examination of its overall diversity.  \b \i0 \ul0 [*2]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Only after reviewing the findings as a whole did it decide to use race at all, and then only in a very limited way. The review included initially identifying underrepresented student groups, studying classroom demographics, surveying student attitudes on diversity, examining \b \i0 \ul0 [**11]\b0 \i0 \ul0   its race-neutral admissions plan and outreach efforts, and analyzing its role as a flagship university in producing a diverse group of leaders. Despite this broad-based approach and the Court's deference to a university's judgment in determining its compelling interest in diversity, petitioner asks this Court to substitute its judgment for that of UT and to hold that the number of Latino and African-American students admitted through the Top-Ten Percent law was sufficient and that a blended admissions plan was unnecessary.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Fifth Circuit appropriately held that UT's limited use of race is narrowly tailored. UT uses race as one nonpredominant factor among many others in a system designed to consider each applicant as an individual. Having failed to rank in the top ten percent of her graduating class and earn automatic admission into UT, and having been denied direct admission after a holistic, individualized review of seventeen separate factors, petitioner asks this Court to focus solely on one criterion--SAT scores-and thus to substitute petitioner's preferred admissions criterion for UT's versatile approach. Nothing in the Constitution or in this Court's precedents justifies that \b \i0 \ul0 [**12]\b0 \i0 \ul0   result.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Based on UT's role as the state's flagship public university, its diversity plan helps to address institutional barriers that have historically prevented Latinos from participating fully in civic life. Indeed,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*3]\b0 \i0 \ul0   the UT plan positively influences Latinos' participation in civic affairs, in political and military leadership, and in meeting the needs of Texas businesses in today's global economy. In light of the past discrimination against Latinos in Texas and continuing institutional barriers that still unfortunately exist, it is appropriate for UT to diversify its student body in a constitutional manner by opening its doors to highly qualified Latinos, among other highly qualified students of diverse backgrounds.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 I. UT HAS A COMPELLING GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST IN CLASSROOM DIVERSITY, AND ITS ADMISSIONS PLAN IS NARROWLY TAILORED TO FURTHER THAT LEGITIMATE END\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A. UT Has A Compelling Interest In Achieving Diversity\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter v. Bollinger,\b0 \i0 \ul0  539 U.S. 306 (2003), this Court held unequivocally that a university has "a compelling state interest in student body diversity." \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 328; \b0 \i \ul0 see also \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 328-31. \b \i0 \ul0 [**13]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Indeed, "attaining a diverse student body is at the heart of [a university's] proper institutional mission, and ... 'good faith' on the part of a university is 'presumed' absent 'a showing to the contrary.'" \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 329 (quoting \b0 \i \ul0 Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke,\b0 \i0 \ul0  438 U.S. 265, 318-19 (1978) (opinion of Powell, J.)). Following \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter,\b0 \i0 \ul0  UT carefully sought to determine whether its student enrollment lacked the diversity it sought to fulfill its mission as the premier flagship university in Texas, and if so, how it might constitutionally seek to obtain that diversity.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360  \b \i0 \ul0 [*4]\b0 \i0 \ul0   After careful evaluation of its admissions program and the student body, UT determined, like the University of Michigan Law School ("UMLS") in \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter,\b0 \i0 \ul0  that the benefits flowing from a diverse student body had not been achieved using an exclusively race-neutral admissions plan. UT's pursuit of diversity is not equivalent to a racial quota or an attempt to have UT's student body mirror the demographics of Texas. Rather, as in \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter,\b0 \i0 \ul0  UT's admissions plan "is defined by reference to the educational benefits that diversity is designed to produce." 539 U.S. at 330. \b \i0 \ul0 [**14]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In particular, UT conducted a study in the wake of \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter\b0 \i0 \ul0  to assess whether its wholly race-neutral admissions programs--the Top-Ten Percent ("TTP") plan--had achieved a "critical mass" of diverse students. n2 As part of that study, UT conducted a survey of students and found that UT minority students reported feeling isolated and a majority of UT students in general stated that there was insufficient diversity  \b \i0 \ul0 [*5]\b0 \i0 \ul0   in the classroom. n3 App. 125a. The survey accorded with UT's statistical study of classroom demographics, which determined that a substantial proportion of undergraduate classes contained one or zero underrepresented minority students. \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  The study found that "in 2002, 90 percent of classes with 5 to 24 students had one or zero African American students and 43 percent had one or zero Hispanic students." \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  Diversity in the classroom remained highly elusive notwithstanding the dramatic increases in Latino high school graduates and Latino applicants to UT. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  Tex. Educ. Agency, Count of Graduates by Ethnicity, PEIMS Data, at 10, 19, Dkt. No. 94-1 ("PEIMS Data"); Univ. of Tex. Office of Admissions, \b0 \i \ul0 Implementation and Results of the Texas Automatic\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b \i0 \ul0 [**15]\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b0 \i \ul0  Admissions Law (HB 588) at The University of Texas at Austin,\b0 \i0 \ul0  Demographic Analysis of Entering Freshmen Fall 2006 at 9, Dkt.

\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n2 Petitioner's argument that the race-neutral TTP law had helped restore UT's enrollment to levels for Latino and African-American students that had been achieved prior to \b0 \i \ul0 Hopwood v. Texas,\b0 \i0 \ul0  78 F.3d 932 (5th Cir. 1996), and therefore foreclosed UT's consideration of race, fails for at least two reasons. First, petitioner is wrong to assume that \b0 \i \ul0 pre-Hopwood\b0 \i0 \ul0  admitted classes ever included a diverse pool of students sufficient to fulfill UT's mission. Second, petitioners ignore the fact that the increase in minority student enrollment at UT likely reflected the huge increase in Latino and African-American students enrolling in Texas public schools since the \b0 \i \ul0 Hopwood\b0 \i0 \ul0  decision in 1996. The two student groups comprised 97% of the total student growth. \b0 \i \ul0 See \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 West Orange-Cove Consol. Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Neeley,\b0 \i0 \ul0  No. GV-100528, 2004 WL 5719215 (Tex. Dist. Nov. 30, 2004) (Finding of Fact 68).

\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n3 In these circumstances, students report that they rely on campus organizations for support. For example, one Latina student, the leader of the Longhorn League of United Latin American Citizens, explained that her organization was inspired to create on-campus annual leadership summits to recruit high school students into higher education "because of the lack of Latino and other minority students at the University."

\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n4 UT administrators have echoed these findings. For example, Bruce Walker, Director of Admissions at UT-Austin, testified that underrepresented minority students reported feeling isolated and that there was insufficient diversity. JA 267a-68a.

\par \fs20 \pard 
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In addition to the survey and classroom study, UT examined its race-neutral admissions plan and  \b \i0 \ul0 [*6]\b0 \i0 \ul0   outreach, n5 analyzed the performance of underrepresented groups in entering the existing labor force, and reviewed its role as a flagship university in producing a diverse group of leaders that would benefit the state, the nation, and the world. SJA 1a-3a, 6a-7a, 24a.
\par \pard 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n5 At the time UT considered adding race for underrepresented groups as a nonpredominant factor among many others, Latino students comprised only fourteen percent of the enrollment. SJA 25a.
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \fs20 \pard 
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Based on these findings, UT determined that a sufficiently diverse student body had not yet been achieved. That determination \b \i0 \ul0 [**17]\b0 \i0 \ul0   "tak[es] into account complex educational judgments in an area that lies primarily within the expertise of the university," and, as such, is entitled to deference. \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter,\b0 \i0 \ul0  539 U.S. at 328. Deference is particularly appropriate because UT's conception of diversity is identical to the one ratified in \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 UMLS defined "critical mass" as "a number that encourages underrepresented minority students to participate \b0 \i \ul0 in the classroom and not feel isolated,"\b0 \i0 \ul0  or "numbers such that underrepresented minority students do not feel \b0 \i \ul0 isolated or like spokespersons for their race." \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter,\b0 \i0 \ul0  539 U.S. at 318-19 (emphases added). UT--far from establishing a pre-determined quota or percentage of minority applicants to be admitted--similarly focused its diversity study on the \b0 \i \ul0 classroom\b0 \i0 \ul0  and whether minority students felt isolated there. UT found in that study that a high number of UT classes included no more than one minority student, and thus reasonably determined that those students would feel "isolated" "in the classroom," and  \b \i0 \ul0 [*7]\b0 \i0 \ul0   "feel ... like spokespersons for their race." \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  This determination was supported by the numerous responses of \b \i0 \ul0 [**18]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Latino and other minority students who reported feeling isolated in the classroom. Importantly, petitioner has offered no evidence to contradict UT's finding that a critical mass was lacking in its classrooms or that Latino and African-American students felt isolated in the classroom or like spokespersons for their race.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Moreover, \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter\b0 \i0 \ul0  embraced the view that universities may seek increased diversity to "promote[] 'cross-racial understanding,' help[] to break down racial stereotypes, and 'enable[] [students] to better understand persons of different races.' These benefits are 'important and laudable,' because 'classroom discussion is livelier, more spirited, and simply more enlightening and interesting' when the students have 'the greatest possible variety of backgrounds."' \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter,\b0 \i0 \ul0  539 U.S. at 330 (quoting district court opinion in \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter\b0 \i0 \ul0 ) (fourth alteration in original). Again, UT's uncontradicted findings support its determination that it had yet to achieve a "critical mass" of minority students, and that it needed to supplement its race-neutral admissions program in order to reap the many benefits of diversity in its classrooms. \b0 \i \ul0 Amici\b0 \i0 \ul0  urge \b \i0 \ul0 [**19]\b0 \i0 \ul0   this Court not to upset this delicate balance, and instead to defer to UT's "complex educational judgments." \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 328.
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 B. UT's Admissions Program Is Narrowly Tailored\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Following its comprehensive study concluding that its race-neutral approaches failed to deliver fully to its student the benefits of diversity, UT closely  \b \i0 \ul0 [*8]\b0 \i0 \ul0   modeled the race-conscious portion of its admissions program on the one affirmed in \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter.\b0 \i0 \ul0  Accordingly, like UMLS, UT "engages in a highly individualized, holistic review of each applicant's file, giving serious consideration to all the ways an applicant might contribute to a diverse educational environment." \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter,\b0 \i0 \ul0  539 U.S. at 337. Indeed, UT's consideration of race in admissions is significantly more narrowly tailored than the program upheld in \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 To begin, UT's race-conscious, holistic program only applies to the minority of applicants who were not automatically admitted under the race-neutral TTP law. n6 For the non-TTP applicants, UT determines admission based on the applicant's Academic Index/Personal Achievement Index scores. The Academic Index score predicts the applicant's freshman GPA \b \i0 \ul0 [**20]\b0 \i0 \ul0   at UT based on factors such as high school class rank and SAT or ACT score. The Personal Achievement Index score is derived from three discrete elements, which are the applicant's scores on each of two essays and her "personal achievement score." The latter is based on a "holistic review" of the "applicant's demonstrated leadership qualities, extracurricular activities, awards and honors, work experience, service to the school or community, and special circumstances." App. 133a.
\par \pard 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n6 The TTP program is itself race-neutral, and no one disputes its constitutionality.
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \fs20 \pard 
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In evaluating the applicant's "special circumstances," in turn, UT considers seven factors: the applicant's socio-economic status, her school's socioeconomic status, her family responsibilities, whether  \b \i0 \ul0 [*9]\b0 \i0 \ul0   she lives in a single-parent home, whether languages other than English are spoken at home, her SAT/ACT score compared to her school's average score, and race. App. 159a n.13. In this way, UT's consideration of race is highly limited--it is \b \i0 \ul0 [**21]\b0 \i0 \ul0   "a factor of a factor of a factor of a factor." \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 159a. And contrary to being a quota system, UT's plan conforms to \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter's\b0 \i0 \ul0  mandate that each applicant be "evaluated as an individual and not in a way that makes [the] applicant's race or ethnicity the defining feature of his or her application." 539 U.S. at 337.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Petitioner and her supporting \b0 \i \ul0 amici\b0 \i0 \ul0  ignore UT's comprehensive plan and holistic consideration of seventeen factors. \b0 \i \ul0 Cf.\b0 \i0 \ul0  SJA 28a-29a. Indeed, petitioner asks this Court to ignore the fact that she failed to rank in the top ten percent of her graduating class (thus reducing her chances of gaining admission by eighty percent), and then failed to gain admission under the individualized, holistic review process--unlike 6,582 other white students admitted in 2008. SJA 156a. Instead, petitioner asks this Court to focus its attention on one criterion--SAT scores--which is the one factor that has a disparate impact against Latino and African-American students. n7 In essence, petitioner and her \b0 \i \ul0 amid\b0 \i0 \ul0  ask the Court to set aside an admissions plan that entails a holistic review of applicants' other talents, and replace it with a plan tailored only \b \i0 \ul0 [**22]\b0 \i0 \ul0   to her strengths. \b0 \i \ul0 See Parents Involved in \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Cmty. Schs. v. Seattle Sch. Dist.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  551 U.S. 701, 798 (2007) (Kennedy, J., concurring  \b \i0 \ul0 [*10]\b0 \i0 \ul0   in part and concurring in the judgment) ("Race may be one component of that diversity, but other demographic factors, plus special talents and needs, should also be considered.").

JA 131a. In fact, UT's Latino enrollment for students admitted outside the TTP plan fluctuated in numbers and percentages between the years 2005 and 2008, ranging from 158 to 343 Latino students. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  Univ. of Tex. at Austin, Research Section, Office of Admissions, \b0 \i \ul0 Implementation and Results of the Texas Automatic Admissions Law (HB 588) at the University of Texas at Austin\b0 \i0 \ul0  7 (2008). n9 These aspects of UT's admissions plan demonstrate UT's faithful commitment not to evaluate applications expressly for race or ethnicity. n10

One key metric of effective civic participation is voting registration and turnout. Although the Latino population is growing rapidly, it still lags behind other groups in voter participation. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  Mark Hugo Lopez, Pew Hispanic Center, \b0 \i \ul0 The Latino Electorate in 2010: More Voters, More Non-Voters,\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 5-6 (2011). n11 The figures from the 2010  \b \i0 \ul0 [*13]\b0 \i0 \ul0   elections show that Texas's situation is even more severe than the national disparity.

Low Latino voter registration and turnout can be attributed in part to Texas's continuing history of discrimination in voting. Nearly forty years ago in \b0 \i \ul0 White v.

Perry,\b0 \i0 \ul0  548 U.S. 399, 440 (2006) (Kennedy, J.) ("In essence the State took away the Latinos' opportunity because Latinos were about to exercise it."). And Texas has not ceased enacting laws that create barriers to voting for Latinos. See, \b0 \i \ul0 e.g., Perez v. Perry,\b0 \i0 \ul0  No. 11-ca-360, Dkt. 60, at 11-12 (W.D. Tex.

Q. 231, 244 (2003). For example, across a series of interviews with Latino adolescents, researchers found that "the theme of exemplary adult role models as sources of inspiration and pride was consistent," and the students "could articulate  \b \i0 \ul0 [*15]\b0 \i0 \ul0   many of the functions served by role models (e.g., inspiration, guide to achieving goals and dreams)." \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  The limiting factor seemed to be adolescents' "limited networks," which "left them often perplexed as to who they could identify as models." \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  In other words, role models exert a powerful influence on Latino youth, but there are simply too few of them.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 As this Court recognized in \b0 \i \ul0 Perry,\b0 \i0 \ul0  Texas's history of discrimination has been long and pervasive. Historical discrimination has been particularly virulent--and has had particularly significant lasting effects--in the area \b \i0 \ul0 [**54]\b0 \i0 \ul0   of education. By the 1920s, school segregation in Texas had "received endorsement not only from the Superintendent of Public Instruction and the state, but from University of Texas scholars as well." Tijerina Expert Report at 25-26, \b0 \i \ul0 Texas v. Holder,\b0 \i0 \ul0  No. 12-cv-00128 (D.D.C. 2012), Dkt. 241-2. Many school districts established "Mexican schools," and by the 1930's, 90% of South Texas schools were segregated. See Jorge C. Rangel & Carlos M. Alcala, \b0 \i \ul0 Project Report: De Jure Segregation of Chicanos in Texas Schools,\b0 \i0 \ul0  7 Harv. C.R.-C.L. L. Rev. 307 (1972). Through the early twentieth century, districts intentionally channeled Latino students into substandard "Mexican" and "migratory" schools. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  Kristi L. Bowman, \b0 \i \ul0 The New Face of School Desegregation,\b0 \i0 \ul0  50 Duke L.J. 1751, 1769 (2001).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Latinos were forced to challenge the segregation and educational inequities in courts across Texas. \b0 \i \ul0 See, e.g., Delgado v. Bastrop Indep. Sch.

Jan. 11, 1957). Indeed, Latinos were not identified as a distinct, suspect class for equal protection purposes until \b0 \i \ul0 Hernandez v. Texas,\b0 \i0 \ul0  347 U.S. 475 (1954), in which this Court cited the segregation of Latino schoolchildren as evidence that the white community considered Latinos a separate race. \b0 \i \ul0 See \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 479-80.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The serious educational disadvantages borne by Latinos are exacerbated by low socio-economic status. In multiple studies, the U.S. Department of Education has found that student achievement is adversely affected by poverty, n52 a significant problem for Latinos because of their disproportionately high poverty rates. See U.S. Census Bureau, Poverty, \b0 \i \ul0 Highlights\b0 \i0 \ul0  (2011) (26.6 percent of Latino families below poverty level). n53 In each of the Texas counties with large Latino populations, Latinos have lower educational attainment levels, lower income levels, and a higher poverty rate than non-Latinos. This is  \b \i0 \ul0 [*35]\b0 \i0 \ul0   true even when controlling for various demographic differences. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  Chapa Expert Report at 4, \b0 \i \ul0 Perez v.
