Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 37.6, counsel for amici state that this brief was not authored, in whole or in part, by counsel to a party, and no monetary contribution to the preparation or submission of this brief was made by any person or entity other than amici or their counsel.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund ("AALDEF"), 18 Asian American and Pacific Islander education and youth-serving organizations, and 52 higher education faculty and officials (listed in full in the Appendix) submit this brief as amici curiae in support of Respondents in this case. Amici comprise a broad range of organizations and individuals working on issues affecting Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in kindergarten through 12th grade and higher education.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 AALDEF, headquartered in New York City and founded in 1974, is a national organization that protects and promotes the civil rights of Asian Americans. By combining litigation, advocacy, education, and organizing, AALDEF's Educational Equity Program promotes the rights of Asian American and Pacific Islander students in K-12 and higher education. AALDEF has an interest in this litigation because its work with community-based youth advocates across the country reveals that  \b \i0 \ul0 [*2]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Asian American and Pacific Islander students benefit from individualized race-conscious admissions policies as well as from diverse educational settings.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Two amici are organizations with the express purpose of supporting Asian American and Pacific Islander staff and students at the University of Texas at Austin ("UT"). The Asian/Asian American Faculty and Staff Association aims to unite Asian and Asian American faculty and staff at UT and promotes networking and support for equal opportunity, growth, and mutual benefit among its constituents. The Asian Desi Pacific Islander American Collective is a student organization dedicated to empowering Asian American and Pacific Islander students at UT.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Several other amici are professional associations dedicated to supporting Asian American and Pacific Islander faculty and staff at institutions of higher education nationwide. These amici's members and participants include over 1000 Asian American and Pacific Islander higher education professionals with firsthand knowledge of the benefits of diversity at their places of employment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Other amici are nonprofit organizations that advocate on behalf of or provide social services to Asian American and Pacific Islander high school-aged youth across the United States. Many of these youth-serving, organizations are members of the National Asian American Education Advocates Network, a K-12 education advocacy consortium.  \b \i0 \ul0 [*3]\b0 \i0 \ul0   These amici have a unique understanding of the needs and experiences of underserved Asian American and Pacific Islander youth who are preparing for college.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Finally, many undersigned amici are individual faculty members and officials at institutions of higher education. Ten are employed at UT itself. A number of these amici are education, legal, and social science scholars whose work examines the diverse educational experiences of Asian American and Pacific Islander communities. Many have taught in higher education and produced scholarship about the impact of educational admissions policies on Asian American and Pacific Islander students.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Based on these collective experiences, amici are well qualified to answer a key question before the Court: how narrowly-tailored, individualized, race-conscious admissions policies impact Asian American and Pacific Islander students in higher education.

\par \pard 
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The admission of students with a "broad[] array of qualifications and characteristics" advances the compelling interest of colleges and universities in attaining a diverse student body and the educational benefits that follow. \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter v. Bollinger,\b0 \i0 \ul0  539 U.S. 306, 325 (2003) (quoting \b0 \i \ul0 Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke,\b0 \i0 \ul0  438 U.S. 265, 315 (1978) (opinion of \b \i0 \ul0 [**11]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Powell, J.)). By considering the achievements of undergraduate applicants in the context of the attributes and obstacles that have influenced them,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*4]\b0 \i0 \ul0   institutions like UT not only enrich academic discourse and classroom learning, but also open new pathways for success.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Racial and ethnic origin is but "one modest factor among many others" considered in the larger achievement matrix that UT uses in its individualized review of applicants who are not entitled to automatic admission under Texas's Top Ten Percent Law ("Top 10% Law"). \b0 \i \ul0 See \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter,\b0 \i0 \ul0  539 U.S. at 393 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). It provides an important texture to an applicant's profile without predominating over other defining qualities and factors. Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders--a unique cross-section of identities and experiences that spans a range of comparative privilege and disadvantage--benefit from this individualized approach to admissions, as do Africans Americans, Latinos, and Whites.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Petitioner and some of the amici who support her position erroneously assert that African Americans and Latinos are the only beneficiaries of UT's admissions policy. From this faulty premise, they incorrectly \b \i0 \ul0 [**12]\b0 \i0 \ul0   contend that UT has expanded admissions opportunities for African Americans and Latinos at the expense of Asian Americans and Whites.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In reality, a narrowly tailored, \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter\b0 \i0 \ul0 -compliant admissions program like UT's strongly benefits the Asian American and Pacific Islander community. UT's individualized review allows for the consideration of educational inequities faced by  \b \i0 \ul0 [*5]\b0 \i0 \ul0   students from certain subgroups that are frequently hidden by the aggregation of data into a single "Asian" category. Students belonging to these subgroups in Texas and elsewhere have faced pervasive social and economic disadvantages akin to that experienced by many African Americans and Latinos, educational attainment levels that are among the lowest of all ethnic and racial groups, and even racial intimidation and harassment. Many of their parents (if not the students themselves) made a difficult transition to the United States as refugees, and others come from communities that have been subjected to colonization on their own native land. By considering the role that these students' racial and ethnic origin have had on their experiences and achievements, UT's admissions process encourages racial disaggregation \b \i0 \ul0 [**13]\b0 \i0 \ul0   and individualized treatment and thwarts the harmful "model minority" myth that masks tremendous diversity within the Asian American and Pacific Islander community.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Several key arguments presented by Petitioner and her amici rely on factual distortions and the improper treatment of Asian Americans as a monolithic group. First, they assert that UT has deemed Asian Americans to be "overrepresented" on its campus. That claim is completely untrue. Second, they assert that UT has limited admission of Asian American students in order to match the racial demographics of Texas. Since UT adopted its race-conscious policy, however, the percentage of Asian American students enrolled at UT has  \b \i0 \ul0 [*6]\b0 \i0 \ul0   exceeded the percentage of Asian Americans in Texas by more than a factor of five.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Third, Petitioner and her amici attempt to show that UT has engaged in discrimination against Asian American applicants, but their analyses are hopelessly riddled with legal and methodological errors. They conflate distinct concepts--affirmative action and negative action--producing a muddled and highly misleading picture of admissions at UT and other selective universities. In reality, UT utilizes affirmative \b \i0 \ul0 [**14]\b0 \i0 \ul0   action to take into account the race of applicants on an individualized basis and enroll students from diverse backgrounds. This is entirely distinct from negative action, whereby a university discriminates against a racial group in order to suppress their levels of enrollment. The undersigned amici would vigorously oppose any form of negative action, formal or informal, affecting Asian Americans or any other group--but there is simply no evidence of it at UT. Petitioner's amici also attempt to prove discrimination based on differential standardized test scores, but they ignore the strong consensus of social scientists that such differences reflect disparities already present in the applicant pool and, indeed, have existed for many years in UT's Top 10% plan and other race-neutral admission programs.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In the end, despite claims by Petitioner and her amici that Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are poised to reclaim opportunities lost to diversity initiatives should this Court rule against UT's admissions program, the overwhelming evidence  \b \i0 \ul0 [*7]\b0 \i0 \ul0   indicates the opposite. Many Asian applicants in communities struggling with low educational attainment will suffer if admissions programs \b \i0 \ul0 [**15]\b0 \i0 \ul0   such as UT's are dismantled.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Equally important, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders--along with students of other races--will not experience the kind of diversity that enriches their education and prepares them for careers in an increasingly intercultural and global workplace. Petitioner's challenge endangers "[b]road access to the education that leads to leadership roles [and that is] essential to public confidence in the fairness and integrity of public institutions."

Bollinger,\b0 \i0 \ul0  539 U.S. 306, 325 (2003) (No. 02-241).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 For these reasons and those described below, this Court should uphold UT's admissions policy and the rulings of the courts below.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 I. UT'S ADMISSION PROCESS DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST OR DISADVANTAGE ASIAN AMERICAN APPLICANTS.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The record below establishes that in its effort to obtain the educational benefits that result from student diversity, UT uses race within the context of "a highly individualized, holistic review" that gives "serious consideration to all the ways an applicant might contribute \b \i0 \ul0 [**16]\b0 \i0 \ul0   to a diverse educational  \b \i0 \ul0 [*8]\b0 \i0 \ul0   environment." See \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter,\b0 \i0 \ul0  539 U.S. at 337. As Petitioner has admitted, UT has not established a "goal, target, or other quantitative objective" for the admission of any particular group. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  JA 131a. Instead, it allows applicants of all races, including Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, to benefit from the consideration of their race in the distinctive context of their background and experience. As discussed below, the arguments by Petitioner and her amici that Asian Americans are somehow victimized by this policy of individualized review are entirely unfounded in law and fact. n2

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A. UT Does Not Treat Asian Americans as Overrepresented.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Petitioner and her supporting amici repeatedly claim that UT has deemed Asian Americans to be "overrepresented" in its student population. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  Pet. Br. at 7, 19, 28 n.  \b \i0 \ul0 [**17]\b0 \i0 \ul0   7; \b0 \i \ul0 see also\b0 \i0 \ul0  Brief for the Asian American Legal Foundation and the Judicial Education Project as Amici Curiae in Support of Petitioners ("AALF Br.") at 2, 9, 12-13 n.7, 22. From this premise alone, Fisher concludes that UT "employs race in admissions decisions to the detriment of Asian Americans." Pet. Br. at 7. Amici AALF similarly asserts that "[t]he very fact that UT currently deems Asian Americans overrepresented  \b \i0 \ul0 [*9]\b0 \i0 \ul0   . . . shows that the use of race in admissions will aim to reduce the representation of Asian Americans while increasing the representation of Hispanics and African Americans." AALF Br. at 2.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Such a claim - involving the numerical balancing of racial groups by a university bureaucracy and the imposition of a glass ceiling on a group deemed to have performed too well - would be deeply troubling, if true. It is not.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 There is no support for Petitioner's claims in the record. She cites UT's Proposal to Consider Race and Ethnicity in Admissions, dated June 25, 2004, \b0 \i \ul0 see\b0 \i0 \ul0  Pet. Br. at 7 (citing SJA 25a), but nowhere in this document is the word "overrepresented" used. Instead, UT described African American and Hispanic students as underrepresented based on \b \i0 \ul0 [**18]\b0 \i0 \ul0   their overall enrollment and classroom presence at the university. UT did not find, and there is no basis for concluding, that Asian Americans or any other group has been deemed overrepresented.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Petitioner also refers to the District Court opinion in this case. See Pet. Br. at 19 (citing App. 154a). There, in finding that under \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter,\b0 \i0 \ul0  UT could consider Texas population data in determining "which minority groups qualify as underrepresented and which ones do not," Judge Sparks observed that "compared to their percentage of Texas' population as a whole, Hispanics remain underrepresented" while Asian Americans "are largely \b0 \i \ul0 over\b0 \i0 \ul0  represented compared to their percentage of Texas' population." \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  App. 154a-155a (emphasis in original). The  \b \i0 \ul0 [*10]\b0 \i0 \ul0   court's empirical observation about the differences between the UT student population and Texas demographics does not support Petitioner's claim about UT's admission policies. To the contrary, as the District Court observed, the fact that the percentage of Asian American students at UT is five times larger than the percentage of Asian Americans in Texas is compelling evidence that no ceiling has been imposed. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  App. 156a,  \b \i0 \ul0 [**19]\b0 \i0 \ul0   n.11. In other words, as discussed in Section II.B, \b0 \i \ul0 infra,\b0 \i0 \ul0  the data only negate Petitioner's claim that UT has limited Asian American admissions to mirror Texas demography.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 For this reason, admission policies at UT cannot reasonably be compared to the abhorrent quotas and restrictive polices imposed against Jews throughout the past century. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  AALF Br. at 18-19; Brief Amicus Curiae of the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law, The 80-20 National Asian-American Educational Foundation, et al., in Support of Petitioner ("80-20 Br.") at 20-34. Without question, there is a disturbing history of discriminatory admission policies, particularly at elite private universities, affecting Jews, African Americans, Asian Americans, women, and others. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  Jerome Karabel, \b0 \i \ul0 The Chosen: The Hidden History of Admission and Exclusion at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton\b0 \i0 \ul0  (2005). Nor do amici deny the possibility that some institutions may apply exclusionary policies against minority applicants, including Asian Americans, today. As discussed below, amici would vigorously oppose any cap, quota, or other kind of negative action, formal or informal,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*11]\b0 \i0 \ul0   against any racial group.  \b \i0 \ul0 [**20]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Nevertheless, there is no evidence that UT has suppressed Asian American admissions in any manner. Indeed, all evidence is to the contrary.
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 B. UT Has Not Limited Asian American Admissions to Match the Racial Demographics of Texas.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Petitioner and her supporting amici claim that UT has limited admission of Asian American students to "mirror the demographics of Texas." See, Pet. Br. at 19; \b0 \i \ul0 see also id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 28 (referring to "UT's differing treatment of Asian Americans and other minorities based on each group's proportion of Texas's population"); AALF Br. at 2 (asserting that "UT currently deems Asian Americans overrepresented and seeks to reduce demographic differences between its student population and the State as whole"). This claim is also baseless.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 A simple comparison of the numbers of Asian Americans that UT admitted and enrolled and the percentage of Asian Americans in Texas shows that UT has not tried to match the two. The Asian American population in Texas has rapidly expanded over the last 30 years, reaching 3.8% of the state population in 2010. n3 Nevertheless, Asian American  \b \i0 \ul0 [*12]\b0 \i0 \ul0   enrollment at UT has increased at an even faster rate. From 1986 to 2001, enrollment \b \i0 \ul0 [**21]\b0 \i0 \ul0   of Asian Americans at UT increased from 6% to 19%. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  UT Austin, \b0 \i \ul0 1995-1996 Statistical Handbook--Students\b0 \i0 \ul0  21; UT Austin, \b0 \i \ul0 2001-2002 Statistical Handbook-Students\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 25. n4 From 1999 to 2010, enrollment of Asian Americans from Texas remained in the range of 17% to 20%. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  SJA 157a; UT Austin, \b0 \i \ul0 Implementation and Results of the Texas Automatic Admissions Law,\b0 \i0 \ul0  Dec. 23, 2010 ("2010 Top 10% Report") at 8. The latter period encompasses both six years of race-neutral admissions (following \b0 \i \ul0 Hopwood v. Texas,\b0 \i0 \ul0  78 F.3d 932 (5th Cir. 1996)) and six years of race-conscious admissions (following  \b \i0 \ul0 [*13]\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter).\b0 \i0 \ul0  If the "core purpose" of the current policy has in fact been "to decrease or limit" the percentage of Asian Americans students to match "the racial composition of the State," see AALF Br. at 7-8, UT has done, as the District Court observed, "a particularly bad job of it," App. 156a, n.11.

\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 n3 In 1980, 120,000 Asian Americans lived in Texas, making up only 0.8% of the overall state population. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  Campbell Gibson & Kay Jung, U.S. Census Bureau, \b0 \i \ul0 Historical Census Statistics on Population Totals by Race, 1790 to 1990, and by Hispanic Origin, 1970 to 1990 for the United States, Regions, Divisions and States,\b0 \i0 \ul0  tbl.58 (2002).

\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 n4 Admissions numbers reflect a similar trend. From 1990 to 2009, the number of Asian American applicants whom UT admitted rose from 10% to 18% of all admitted students. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  UT Austin, \b0 \i \ul0 1990-1991 Statistical Handbook--Students\b0 \i0 \ul0  23; UT Austin, \b0 \i \ul0 2009-2010 Statistical Handbook--Students\b0 \i0 \ul0  24. UT's Statistical Handbooks consolidate data on Asian American admittees from within and outside Texas. UT's Top 10% Reports distinguish between these groups.

\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Acknowledging that "the total number and percentage of Asian Americans have in fact increased at UT in the last ten years," amicus AALF weakly posits that UT's "efforts at racial balancing" have been "less effective than it would like." AALF Br. at 12-13 n.7. But there is no basis in the record to suggest that UT has sought this goal. To the contrary, the record shows that the consideration of race in UT's admissions process can positively impact applicants of any race, and the university makes no effort to monitor the number of applicants admitted in any particular group to ensure that a particular threshold is met. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  JA 206a (Ishop Dep.  \b \i0 \ul0 [**23]\b0 \i0 \ul0   ); JA 284a-285a (Walker Dep.); JA 398a.

AALF. Br. at 12-13 n.7. AALF cites no evidence in support of this argument.

An individualized affirmative \b \i0 \ul0 [**25]\b0 \i0 \ul0   action program is completely distinct from negative action, which involves discrimination by a university to suppress enrollment of a particular racial group, such as Asian Americans. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  William C.

In other words, when Espenshade suggests that Asian Americans would benefit from the elimination of race-conscious admissions, he includes in his analysis the removal of a 50-SAT-point advantage that White applicants received over Asian Americans \b0 \i \ul0 (i.e.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  negative action). \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  Thomas J.

The same data in Espenshade's more recent book confirm that in his model, in terms of the overall impact on Asian American admission offers, ending negative action was estimated to have an effect more than five times greater than the effect of ending affirmative action for African American and Latino students. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  Thomas J.

Other academics have challenged Espenshade's work as misleading or "internally contradictory" because it "confounds the role of negative action . . . with the role of affirmative action," and have described his conclusions as "untenable" because they assume that "the role of negative action is truly de minimis." \b0 \i \ul0 See, e.g.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  William C.

Although these amici attribute these differences to UT's race-conscious admissions policy, their claim is fatally undermined by the fact that similar variations in SAT scores existed throughout UT's \b0 \i \ul0 race-neutral\b0 \i0 \ul0  admissions between 1997 and 2004. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  SJA 55a-62a.

First, mean SAT scores of Whites and Asians at UT admitted through individualized admissions (both before and after implementation of the current policy) reflect only small differences. n11 Second, an  \b \i0 \ul0 [*23]\b0 \i0 \ul0   analysis of (i) SAT scores by major and (ii) concentration of racial groups across majors reveals a likely nondiscriminatory reason for these differences. UT requires Texas residents to apply to undergraduate programs by selecting a first-choice and second-choice major. n12 Based on these priorities, UT admits students generally into one of six colleges (Liberal Arts, Social Work, Nursing, Business, Communications and Geosciences) or into a specific major at three other colleges (Natural Sciences, Education, and Engineering). Asian Americans at UT are more concentrated in those schools with the highest mean SAT scores at UT (Business, Engineering, and Natural Sciences) and have the lowest concentration in schools with the lowest SAT scores (Liberal Arts, Fine Arts, and Education). \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  SJA 54a-63a; 166a; 2010 Top 10% Report at 14-15. By contrast, Whites have larger concentrations in schools with the lowest SAT scores. Thus, along with \b \i0 \ul0 [**35]\b0 \i0 \ul0   the complex nature of individualized review, the various environmental factors, and issues with the predictive power of SAT scores, students' selection of majors explains in part the minor  \b \i0 \ul0 [*24]\b0 \i0 \ul0   difference in scores between Asian American and White enrollees at UT. n13

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 An overriding theme of Petitioner's and her amici's briefs is that UT's admissions process for non-Top 10% applicants is discriminatory because it uses race to benefit Latinos and African Americans, but not Asian Americans. \b0 \i \ul0 See, e.g.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  Pet.

In fact, UT's policy of individualized review strongly benefits Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders by allowing for the consideration of economic and educational inequities faced by students from certain subgroups-differences that are often hidden by the aggregation of data into a single "Asian" category and the promulgation of the pervasive and harmful "model minority" myth.

AALF Br. at 28. Because Asian Americans as well as Pacific Islanders, with whom Asians have historically been aggregated into  \b \i0 \ul0 [*26]\b0 \i0 \ul0   a combined racial category, have such high levels of diversity, including a wide array of languages and religious and cultural traditions, it is impossible to generalize a "typical" Asian American experience. Robert T. Teranishi, \b0 \i \ul0 Asians In the Ivory Tower: Dilemmas of Racial Inequality in American Higher Education\b0 \i0 \ul0  26 (2010). As discussed below, narrowly tailored, individualized admissions programs like UT's are well suited to take into account the heterogeneity of the Asian American and Pacific Islander community as they pursue the substantial educational benefits of student diversity. \b0 \i \ul0 See, e.g., \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Smith v.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The history of U.S. policy on Asian immigration has vacillated from openness in the late 1800's--when the country needed the pioneering efforts of Asian immigrants--to exclusion during the internment camps of World War II and the anti-Asian immigration acts which largely closed U.S. borders to Asian immigration until the 1950's. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  Angelo N.

According to the 2010 Census, the three largest Asian American ethnic groups in Texas are, in descending order, Indian, Vietnamese, and Chinese. n17 Students in Texas communities with a high concentration of Indian and Chinese students  \b \i0 \ul0 [*32]\b0 \i0 \ul0   tend to be more affluent and achieve higher SAT scores. n18 For example, Coppell, an upper-middle class suburb that has benefited economically \b \i0 \ul0 [**46]\b0 \i0 \ul0   from development near the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, has one of the most distinguished school districts in the state. Fifty-seven percent of the Asian American population in the Coppell school district is Indian. n19 Median  \b \i0 \ul0 [*33]\b0 \i0 \ul0   income in Coppell is $ 101,510, and less than 10% of its students are deemed to be economically disadvantaged.

\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 n18 Even though the Texas Education Agency ("TEA") does not report disaggregated data on Asian American subgroups, disparities can be assessed by comparing economic and educational data for census designated places with data on different Asian subgroup concentrations as surveyed by the U.S. Census Bureau. This analysis shows that as the proportion of Indian and Chinese students in the population increases, both average SAT scores for Asian students and the percentage of Asian students who test as "college ready" tend to increase and the percentage of Asian students deemed "economically disadvantaged" tends to decrease. (The TEA reports only students' math and critical reading scores, even though UT also considers applicants' writing scores in its admissions process.) These trends run inversely as the proportion of Vietnamese students increases: average SAT scores and the percentage of Asian students who test as "college ready" tend to decrease and the percentage of Asian students considered "economically disadvantaged" tends to increase. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  U.S. Census Bureau, \b0 \i \ul0 2006-2010 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates\b0 \i0 \ul0  ("ACS 5-Year Estimates"); Texas Education Agency, \b0 \i \ul0 2009-2010 Academic Excellence Indicator System Reports; see also\b0 \i0 \ul0  U.S. Census Bureau, \b0 \i \ul0 2008-2010 American Community Survey 3-Year Estimates.\b0 \i0 \ul0

After leaving their homeland due to unrest or persecution and arriving with few economic resources, members of refugee communities have sometimes been met with hostility based on race or ethnic origin. In Texas, some Vietnamese refugees found opportunities in commercial shrimping along the Gulf coast.  \b \i0 \ul0 [*34]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Working long hours, these refugees began buying their own boats, only to face intimidation and harassment by armed White supremacists. \b0 \i \ul0 See \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Vietnamese Fishermen's Assoc, v.

JA 209a (Ishop Dep.). Importantly, the consideration of race in admissions can positively impact applicants regardless of whether they belong to an underrepresented  \b \i0 \ul0 [*36]\b0 \i0 \ul0   minority or some other group. See JA 206a (Ishop Dep.); JA 284a-285a (Walker Dep.). In this respect, UT's plan is even more narrowly tailored than the plan in \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter,\b0 \i0 \ul0  in which the University of Michigan Law School considered race as a "plus factor" only with respect to applicants belonging to underrepresented minority groups. \b0 \i \ul0 See \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter,\b0 \i0 \ul0  539 U.S. at 321.

For UT applicants with lower SAT scores and GPAs, consideration of race in the distinctive context of their background and experience may give them a higher PAS. For example, a student of Southeast Asian origin whose parents are refugees and who attends a majority-minority public high school in Texas may receive a higher score than she would absent the consideration of race. A higher PAS will not guarantee her admission to UT, but might improve her chances.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In short, UT's process of individualized review advances its compelling interest in achieving the educational benefits of student diversity, increases the likelihood of admission for those who do not have the same social mobility and capital as others, and has the potential to benefit all Asian American and Pacific Islander applicants.  \b \i0 \ul0 [**53]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Claims that UT's policy pits "one minority group against another," \b0 \i \ul0 see\b0 \i0 \ul0  Pet.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Finally, it is critical to recognize the benefits from the diversity produced by an individualized race-conscious admissions process accrue to all students, including Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. Studies have demonstrated that interactions with a  \b \i0 \ul0 [*38]\b0 \i0 \ul0   diverse student body, both in and out of the classroom, lead to positive learning and civic outcomes for Asian American students. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  NYU CARE, \b0 \i \ul0 Asian Americans and the Benefits of Campus Diversity: What the Research Says\b0 \i0 \ul0  1 (2012); Patricia Gurin et al., \b0 \i \ul0 Diversity and Higher Education: Theory and Impact on Educational Outcomes,\b0 \i0 \ul0  72 Harv.

Higher Educ. 416, 434 (2011) (observing that while \b \i0 \ul0 [**54]\b0 \i0 \ul0   "the effects of intergroup learning on the pluralistic measure were significant for all other groups," Asian American students "seem to demonstrate the strongest benefit"). These benefits continue as students graduate and enter the "increasingly diverse workforce and society." See \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter,\b0 \i0 \ul0  539 U.S. at 330 (citation omitted). Student diversity also has positive social effects on the campus as a whole. See \b0 \i \ul0 Parents Involved in \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Community Schools v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1,\b0 \i0 \ul0  551 U.S. 701, 797-98 (2007) (Kennedy, J., concurring); \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter,\b0 \i0 \ul0  539 U.S. at 328-29; \b0 \i \ul0 Bakke,\b0 \i0 \ul0  438 U.S. at 312-13. Asian Americans and other groups come to see each other more favorably, which leads to improved intergroup relations and reduced racial stereotyping. See \b0 \i \ul0 Grutter,\b0 \i0 \ul0  539 U.S. at 328-29. Because UT's process of individualized review is narrowly tailored to achieve the educational benefits of student diversity, this Court should uphold it as constitutional.
