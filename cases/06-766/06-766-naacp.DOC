\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 QUESTION PRESENTED
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In American Party of Texas v. White, 415 U.S. 767 (1974), this Court held that the Constitution does not necessarily forbid party conventions "in preference to" party primaries as the means for political parties to choose their candidates for elective office. In the decision below, the Second Circuit affirmed a ruling requiring New York's political parties to nominate candidates for trial-court judge by party primaries rather than conventions. In so doing, the Second Circuit invalidated the statute governing judicial nominations in its entirety, even though only certain portions of the statute were deemed unconstitutional.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The question addressed by amici, which is subsumed within the question presented by petitioners, is this:
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0 May a federal court strike \b \i0 \ul0 [**2]\b0 \i0 \ul0   down an entire state statute absent a finding that the legislature's purpose in enacting the statute would be frustrated by removing only its constitutionally defective portions?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This question was addressed by the courts below and is "not foreign to the parties." Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 300 (1989) (considering retroactivity argument raised only by amici).  \b \i0 \ul0 [*ii]\b0 \i0 \ul0

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 INTRODUCTION AND INTERESTS OF \b \i \ul0 AMICI CURIAE\b \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The severability analysis in the decision below warrants reversal even if the Court otherwise affirms that decision. The Second Circuit found that New York's statutory system for nominating party candidates for judicial elections imposed severe burdens on the First Amendment rights of voters and candidates, and struck down the nomination statute in its entirety. Before striking down the entire statute, however, the court was required by long-standing precedent to perform a severability analysis to determine whether the non-defective portions of the statute could be preserved. Had the Second Circuit performed that analysis, it would have concluded that the severe burdens it found were traceable to an isolated portion of the statute; that \b \i0 \ul0 [**5]\b0 \i0 \ul0   the Legislature's purpose in enacting the statute would not be frustrated without the burdensome provisions; and that a more limited remedy was required.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Second Circuit's severability analysis, moreover, not only led to the wrong result in this case, it also has profound implications for future cases in that Circuit and elsewhere. The Second Circuit's approach signals an enormous expansion of judicial power of which this Court has repeatedly disapproved, and that approach should be rejected here as well.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The severability issue in this case is of particular concern to \b0 \i \ul0 amici curiae\b0 \i0 \ul0  Mid-Manhattan NAACP and Metropolitan Black Bar Association, which support equal protection for African-Americans and other minorities in New York City. n1 Both organizations, which are described in more detail in the Appendix, include sitting black Supreme  \b \i0 \ul0 [*2]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Court Justices in their membership, and both have representatives on the judicial screening panel that evaluates candidates for Supreme Court Justice for the First Judicial District--a panel recognized by the district court as "the best in the state." \b0 \i \ul0 Lopez Torres v. New York State Bd. of Elections,\b0 \i0 \ul0  411 F. Supp. 2d 212, 231 (E.D.N.Y. 2006). \b \i0 \ul0 [**6]\b0 \i0 \ul0

\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 n1 The parties have consented to the filing of this brief. No counsel for any party has authored this brief in whole or in part, and no person or entity other than \b0 \i \ul0 amici\b0 \i0 \ul0  and its counsel has made a monetary contribution to the preparation or submission of this brief.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 As organizations with a long history of championing the equal access of blacks and other minorities to elective office in New York, \b0 \i \ul0 amici\b0 \i0 \ul0  are strong proponents of New York's judicial convention system. \b0 \i \ul0 Amici\b0 \i0 \ul0  are especially proud of the record of minority participation that convention system has produced in New York City. \b0 \i \ul0 Amici\b0 \i0 \ul0  believe, however, that the decisions below unnecessarily compromise the success of New York's judicial election procedures. Even if portions of the relevant statutes could not be upheld, wholesale rejection of the convention statute was inappropriate. \b0 \i \ul0 Amici\b0 \i0 \ul0  thus urge the Court to reverse the decision below and thereby ensure that the remedy in this case does not needlessly sacrifice the diversity benefits of the existing convention system.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 STATEMENT\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 1. In 1921, the people of New York, acting through their duly elected legislators, expressed a clear preference \b \i0 \ul0 [**7]\b0 \i0 \ul0   for selecting nominees for the office of New York State Supreme Court Justice through a convention system, rather than direct primary elections.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In more recent years, this convention system has promoted the public welfare by enabling minority candidates to seek and obtain the office of Supreme Court Justice in proportion with the tremendous diversity in New York City. For example, as a result of the convention system, the Supreme Court bench in New York County is currently 44.7 percent minority. n2 Of the 38 Supreme Court  \b \i0 \ul0 [*3]\b0 \i0 \ul0   justices in New York County, 22 are women, nine are African-American, four are Hispanic, and two are Asian-American. n3 In 2002, the First Judicial District convention nominated:

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In the district court, petitioners presented voluminous testimony that a primary system could never achieve the kind of diversity that the convention system does, mainly because "[t]he best single determinant of success in a direct election is the size of the candidate's campaign chest," and minorities tend to have disproportionately smaller fundraising resources. n5 One of petitioners' experts testified that without the convention system "you would have a bunch of rich people [elected] to the bench and there would be no minorit[ies] sitting up there at all." n6 According to this expert, the existing convention system is "a little  \b \i0 \ul0 [*4]\b0 \i0 \ul0   fairer to ordinary people." n7 Another expert testified that primaries would result in "an entirely white bench." n8

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 2. Although the convention system was democratically enacted and has done much to foster diversity on the bench, the courts below held that the statute enacting that system violates the First Amendment and cannot be applied \b \i0 \ul0 [**9]\b0 \i0 \ul0   in its current form. The district court ruled that the statute imposed severe burdens on the First Amendment rights of voters and candidates to have meaningful choice in the election of Supreme Court Justices, without the justification of sufficiently compelling state interests. 411 F. Supp. 2d at 243-255. The district court based this ruling primarily on anecdotal evidence of respondents' difficulties in obtaining the nomination of their parties without the support of party leadership. \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 231-239.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 According to the district court, several features of the judicial election statute were responsible for respondents' alleged difficulties, including: (1) the number of assembly districts from which a candidate must field delegates to the conventions; (2) the number of delegates each candidate must run within each assembly district; (3) the number of signatures each candidate must obtain for each delegate within a 37-day period; (4) the prohibition of identifying the candidate each delegate supports on the ballot; and (5) the impracticality of lobbying delegates to change their votes prior to and at the conventions themselves. \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 217-230. \b \i0 \ul0 [**10]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Based on its finding of a First Amendment violation, the district court enjoined the operation of the entire New York judicial convention system and ordered that direct primary elections be held unless the Legislature can implement a new system before the next election cycle. \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 255-56. The district court did not examine whether the  \b \i0 \ul0 [*5]\b0 \i0 \ul0   convention system could still function in the absence of the provisions it found too burdensome, instead concluding that a primary system was preferable because it "assure[s] that intraparty competition [will be] resolved in a democratic fashion." \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 256 (citation omitted).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Second Circuit affirmed the district court's findings in their entirety. \b0 \i \ul0 Lopez Torres v. New York State Bd. of Elections,\b0 \i0 \ul0  462 F.3d 161, 208 (2d Cir. 2006). The Second Circuit acknowledged the Legislature's preference for holding conventions rather than primaries, as well as the obligation of federal courts not to "nullify more of a legislature's work than is necessary." \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 171-172, 205. But the court failed to examine whether nullifying the entire convention statute was the least invasive \b \i0 \ul0 [**11]\b0 \i0 \ul0   way to remove its constitutional defects. Instead, the court conflated the required practice of striking defective provisions with the impermissible practice of "rewriting" or "modifying" them. \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 206.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In reviewing the district court's requirement that primaries be held in the next election cycle, the Second Circuit considered only two options--striking down the entire convention system and leaving a procedural void for selecting candidates, or striking down the entire convention system and ordering primaries. \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 206-207. This false dichotomy omitted the option of striking down only the defective portions of the convention system and leaving the remainder of that system in place.

\par \pard 
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Even if the Court affirms the Second Circuit's conclusion that New York's convention statute violates the First Amendment in some respects, the Court should reverse the decision below because it nullifies a greater portion of the statute than necessary to remedy those asserted constitutional \b \i0 \ul0 [**12]\b0 \i0 \ul0   defects. To prevent overreaching by the lower federal courts, this Court has provided strict rules for determining how to fashion equitable relief when striking  \b \i0 \ul0 [*6]\b0 \i0 \ul0   down defective statutes. Those rules were not followed in the decisions below.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The correct approach, following a finding that certain features of New York's judicial convention procedures were unconstitutional, would have been to examine whether the remainder of the statute could function in a manner consistent with the Legislature's intent with the defective portions removed. The Second Circuit did not perform that analysis.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Had it done so, the court below would have seen that the Legislature clearly preferred nominating judicial candidates by convention, and that the convention statute could still function robustly with the offending features removed. The result would have been to strike down only the offending features and to leave the rest of the convention statute intact.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Instead, the Second Circuit imposed upon New York a party-primary system that its Legislature expressly discarded in 1921 and that its voters still do not want today. Prominent among the reasons New York's voters want to preserve the convention \b \i0 \ul0 [**13]\b0 \i0 \ul0   system is its proven track record of promoting minority representation in the New York judiciary. But the decision below replaces that process with one preferred, as a matter of public policy or political theory, by unelected federal judges. That decision should be reversed.
\par \pard 
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 ARGUMENT\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 As a preliminary matter, and contrary to the analysis performed below, the severability of a state statute is governed by state law. See \b0 \i \ul0 Leavitt v. Jane L.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  518 U.S. 137, 139 (1996); \b0 \i \ul0 Dorchy v. Kansas,\b0 \i0 \ul0  264 U.S. 286, 290 (1924). Thus, although the rule for determining whether a statute is severable is the same under both New York and federal law, compare \b0 \i \ul0 Hynes v. Tomei,\b0 \i0 \ul0  706 N.E.2d 1201, 1207 (N.Y. 1998), with \b0 \i \ul0 Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New England,\b0 \i0 \ul0  126 S. Ct. 961, 967 (2006), it is  \b \i0 \ul0 [*7]\b0 \i0 \ul0   appropriate to draw upon New York authority in assessing the severability of any provisions found to be constitutionally infirm here.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 As we show in Section I, under New York law, nondefective portions of a statute must be preserved if the state legislature would prefer that result. And as we show in Section II, even if some \b \i0 \ul0 [**14]\b0 \i0 \ul0   portions of the New York convention statute violate the First Amendment, the New York legislature would clearly prefer to retain a convention system rather than switching to a primary system. That preference should be respected.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 I. Under New York Law, Which Controls Here, Non-Defective Portions Of A Statute Must Be Preserved If The Legislature Would Prefer That Result.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 For more than 80 years, New York law has been clear that a court finding specific provisions of a statute invalid must determine "whether the legislature, if partial invalidity had been foreseen, would have wished the statute to be enforced with the invalid part exscinded, or rejected altogether." \b0 \i \ul0 People ex rel. Alpha Portland Cement Co. v. Knapp,\b0 \i0 \ul0  129 N.E. 202, 207 (N.Y. 1920) (Cardozo, J.). To determine what the Legislature "would have wished," New York courts consider the legislative history of the statute, see \b0 \i \ul0 Matter of Westinghouse Elec. Corp. v. Tully,\b0 \i0 \ul0  470 N.E.2d 853, 855 (N.Y. 1984), and ask whether, as a practical matter, the statute would still be capable of functioning "if the knife is laid to the branch instead of at the roots," \b0 \i \ul0 Alpha Portland Cement,\b0 \i0 \ul0  129 N.E. at 207. \b \i0 \ul0 [**15]\b0 \i0 \ul0   n9

\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 n9 A corollary of this functionality test is that, where a defective portion of a statute was added by later amendment, the pre-amendment version of the statute is functional enough to stand on its own. See \b0 \i \ul0 Skaneateles Waterworks Co. v. Village of Skaneateles,\b0 \i0 \ul0  55 N.E. 562, 566-567 (N.Y. 1899) (where unconstitutional provision was not added to statute until 19 years after its passage, "the elimination of that feature of the statute will in no-wise interfere with the just and proper working out of the general purposes of the act"); \b0 \i \ul0 Buckley v. Valeo,\b0 \i0 \ul0  424 U.S. 1, 75-76 (1976) (upholding 1971 campaign spending disclosure statute while striking down 1974 amendment imposing campaign spending limits).

\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360  \b \i0 \ul0 [*8]\b0 \i0 \ul0   The obvious reason for this approach is to keep legislative power out of the hands of the judiciary by limiting a court's power to the minimum necessary to remedy the constitutional infirmity before it. As then-Judge Cardozo explained in \b0 \i \ul0 Alpha Portland Cement,\b0 \i0 \ul0  a court's \b \i0 \ul0 [**16]\b0 \i0 \ul0   "right to destroy [a statute] is bounded by the limits of necessity." 129 N.E. at 208. "Our duty is to save," he wrote, "unless in saving we pervert." \b0 \i \ul0 Ibid.\b0 \i0 \ul0  n10

\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 n10 The limits on the power of federal courts to issue broad injunctions were one of the few issues upon which both the Federalists and the Anti-Federalists agreed. When the Federalists sought to include the phrase "all cases, in law and equity" in describing the powers of the judiciary in Article III, the Anti-Federalists were concerned that "equity" powers could be abused to give judges unfettered discretion. See Letters from The Federal Farmer to The Republican No. 3 (Oct. 10, 1787), in 1 \b0 \i \ul0 The Debate on the Constitution\b0 \i0 \ul0  245, 273 (Bernard Bailyn ed., 1993). Alexander Hamilton's reply for the Federalists was not to defend broad equity powers, but rather to deny that judicial power was broad in the first instance. See Publius [Alexander Hamilton], \b0 \i \ul0 The Federalist\b0 \i0 \ul0  No. 78 (May 28, 1788), in 2 \b0 \i \ul0 The Debate on the Constitution\b0 \i0 \ul0  467, 468 (Bernard Bailyn ed., 1993). Thus, the Anti-Federalists opposed the grant of equity powers to federal courts for fear of the unfettered discretion they would lend, and the Federalists considered the judiciary to be capable of "no active resolution whatever." \b0 \i \ul0 Ibid.\b0 \i0 \ul0  Between them, there is little support for the broad exercise of judicial power in issuing sweeping injunctions when a more limited remedy is available.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360  \b \i0 \ul0 [*9]\b0 \i0 \ul0   For example, in \b0 \i \ul0 In re Orans,\b0 \i0 \ul0  206 N.E.2d 854 (N.Y. 1965), the Court of Appeals examined which portions of the New York State Constitution governing legislative district size could withstand the recently-announced "one man, one vote" apportionment rule of \b0 \i \ul0 Reynolds v. Sims,\b0 \i0 \ul0  377 U.S. 533 (1964). Article III of the New York State Constitution contained numerous mechanisms that combined to give sparsely populated areas of the state greater representation per capita in the Legislature than more densely populated areas. This Court invalidated these mechanisms on Fourteenth Amendment grounds in \b0 \i \ul0 WMCA, Inc. v. Lomenzo,\b0 \i0 \ul0  377 U.S. 633 (1964). The state courts in \b0 \i \ul0 Orans\b0 \i0 \ul0  were left to sort out which other portions of Article III could be preserved in light of \b0 \i \ul0 WMCA.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Citing Judge Cardozo's instructions in \b0 \i \ul0 Alpha Portland Cement,\b0 \i0 \ul0  the Court of Appeals in \b0 \i \ul0 Orans\b0 \i0 \ul0  carefully examined each remaining portion of Article III, "saving as much as possible"  \b \i0 \ul0 [**18]\b0 \i0 \ul0   in order to "carry[] out the will of the people of this State." 206 N.E.2d at 858, 860. The court concluded that only the provisions making election district boundaries "co-terminal" with county borders needed removal, leaving intact other clauses capping the assembly size at 150 members, requiring assembly districts to be "compact * * * convenient and contiguous," allowing the number of senate districts to increase with population growth, and preserving "the historic and traditional significance of counties in the districting process * * * where and as far as possible." \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 859.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Similarly, in \b0 \i \ul0 Schieffelin v. Goldsmith,\b0 \i0 \ul0  170 N.E. 905 (N.Y. 1930), the New York Court of Appeals considered a state statute providing for the appointment of temporary municipal court justices in the event that a sitting justice became unable to perform his duties. The statute gave the mayor authority to appoint temporary replacement justices, but with the proviso that the mayor could choose those replacements only from the membership of the same political party as the justice being replaced. \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 906. This party affiliation limitation was \b \i0 \ul0 [**19]\b0 \i0 \ul0   challenged under Article 13, \'a7 1 of the New York State Constitution,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*10]\b0 \i0 \ul0   which prohibits any "oath, declaration or other test" (other than the oath of office) as a qualification for holding public office. \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 908.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Court of Appeals found that the party affiliation provision could be pruned at the branch without harming the rest of the statute: "It is a complete harmonious statute with that sentence deleted. It affords a complete and definite system for appointing temporary justices. The sentence in question adds nothing to and detracts nothing from the purpose of the act. The provisions of the act are not so interdependent that the act cannot operate without the sentence in question. It is not so related to the other provisions that it can be supposed that the Legislature would not have passed the act without it." \b0 \i \ul0 Ibid.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In so holding, the Court of Appeals distinguished the party affiliation provision in \b0 \i \ul0 Schieffelin\b0 \i0 \ul0  from one that tainted the entire statute in \b0 \i \ul0 Rathbone v. Wirth,\b0 \i0 \ul0  45 N.E. 15 (N.Y. 1896). There, the Court of Appeals had considered a state statute requiring that the four-member Albany police board be composed of two \b \i0 \ul0 [**20]\b0 \i0 \ul0   members from each of the two dominant political parties on the city council. \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 16-17. The statute thus precluded voters from electing a majority from one of the two major parties, and precluded third-party candidates from running at all. \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  The Court of Appeals found these provisions to violate the sections of the New York State Constitution guaranteeing local voters the right to elect local officers of their choosing. \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 17. It then considered whether the defective provisions concerning the composition of the police board could be severed and the rest of the statute concerning the procedural mechanisms for choosing the police board preserved. \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 20.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Court of Appeals performed the familiar severance analysis, asking whether the legislature would have enacted the remainder of the statute had it known the offending provisions were constitutionally defective. The  \b \i0 \ul0 [*11]\b0 \i0 \ul0   answer was clearly "No": "This statute was intended to amend the existing law upon the subject of a police commission, and it is perfectly plain, upon its reading, that what was aimed at was to remove from office the present four commissioners \b \i0 \ul0 [**21]\b0 \i0 \ul0   and all of their subordinates, * * * and to compel the substitution, as commissioners, of four persons, who would be representatives of two certain political organizations. If we eliminate the prescribed methods for the accomplishment of this purpose, we emasculate the legislative act, and it cannot seriously be contended that then there would remain any such law as was intended to be enacted by the legislature." \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 21. According to the court in \b0 \i \ul0 Schieffelin,\b0 \i0 \ul0  "the statute [in \b0 \i \ul0 Rathbone\b0 \i0 \ul0 ], read as a whole, made it apparent that its purpose was to change the political construction of the police department, and to strike out that provision would nullify the purpose of the Legislature. The decision is not in conflict with the holding in this case." 170 N.E. at 908.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Read together, \b0 \i \ul0 Orans, Schieffelin,\b0 \i0 \ul0  and \b0 \i \ul0 Rathbone\b0 \i0 \ul0  provide a three-step process for determining severability. Courts must (1) identify the purpose of the statute in which the defective provision is found; (2) strike out only the minimum language needed to remove the constitutional defect; and (3) determine whether the remainder can still function in a manner consistent with the \b \i0 \ul0 [**22]\b0 \i0 \ul0   previously identified purpose.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 II. The Courts Below Failed To Conduct The Required Severability Analysis, And In So Doing Erred In Eliminating New York's Entire Convention Statute.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The analysis below departs sharply from this well-established framework.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 1. To be sure, the Second Circuit correctly recognized that the purpose of the convention statute was to end a ten-year experiment with primaries that the Legislature had deemed a failure. From the first judicial elections in New York in 1846 until 1911, the political parties employed  \b \i0 \ul0 [*12]\b0 \i0 \ul0   conventions to designate their Supreme Court nominees. 462 F.3d at 171. In 1911, the Legislature, "buoyed by a wave of progressive politics," switched to a primary system. \b0 \i \ul0 Ibid.\b0 \i0 \ul0  The new system soon proved to be problematic: "[O]ver the next decade, concern grew that bare-knuckled primary elections dissuaded qualified candidates from seeking these significant judicial positions. As to those brave enough to enter the contest, observers worried that the need to raise large sums of money might compromise their independence, or at least appear to do so, and lodge effective control of the nominating process in the hands \b \i0 \ul0 [**23]\b0 \i0 \ul0   of the political bosses who directed their party's large election apparatus. As a result of these concerns, in 1921 New York recast the electoral process for Supreme Court justices [by enacting the current statute]." \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 171-172.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In other words, for 150 of the 160 years that New York has elected its Supreme Court Justices, party candidates were chosen by nominating conventions. For the remaining ten years, the State experimented with a primary system much like the one crafted by the district court as a remedy here, but it was deemed to jeopardize the independence of judges due to the large sums of money it required them to raise, and was scrapped. n11 It may be inferred from this legislative history that the purpose of the statute at issue in this case was to create a nomination process that shelters candidates from the need to raise money to finance "bare-knuckled" primary elections.

\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 n11 These concerns were repeated 85 years later in the testimony presented in the district court. See \b0 \i \ul0 supra\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 3-4.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 2. According to the decisions below, the principal defect in the convention statute is the burden created by party rules requiring candidates to field unreasonably large slates of convention delegates. See 462 F.3d at 192; 411 F. Supp. 2d at 220. Under the existing statute, a candidate seeking the office of Supreme Court Justice must  \b \i0 \ul0 [*13]\b0 \i0 \ul0   field a slate of convention delegates and alternate convention delegates from each assembly district ("AD") within the judicial district he or she seeks to represent. See N.Y. Election Law \'a7 6-124. But the statute leaves to the political parties the task of determining how many delegates must be elected from each AD. \b0 \i \ul0 Ibid.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Using this authority, the political parties have devised delegate-allocation formulas yielding what the courts below found to be unreasonably high numbers of delegates per judicial district. For example, a Democratic candidate running for Supreme Court Justice in the Second Judicial District must field a slate of 124 delegates plus 124 alternate delegates--248 total--across the 24 ADs in that judicial district. Even worse, a Republican candidate running in the Tenth Judicial District must field \b \i0 \ul0 [**25]\b0 \i0 \ul0   185 delegates plus 185 alternate delegates--370 total--across that judicial district's 21 ADs. See 411 F. Supp. 2d at 219.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 According to the district court, the statute "make[s] a challenger candidate's effort to elect a majority of delegates more difficult" by "delegating to the major parties the right to determine the number of delegates and alternate delegates" required for nomination. \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 220. "In the Second Judicial District in 2004, for example, such a challenge would require running approximately 250 candidates across 24 ADs and two counties. The sheer number of people a challenger must recruit to run for the office of delegate and alternate delegate is a significant burden in itself." \b0 \i \ul0 Ibid.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Second Circuit agreed, concluding that "the evidence showed that the political parties' delegate-allocation formulae do much more than merely dilute the proportional efficacy of votes \b0 \i \ul0 vis-a-vis\b0 \i0 \ul0  assembly districts within a judicial district. Rather, the evidence showed that a network of restrictive regulations effectively \b0 \i \ul0 excludes\b0 \i0 \ul0  qualified candidates and voters from participating in the primary election and subsequent convention, and thus severely  \b \i0 \ul0 [**26]\b0 \i0 \ul0    \b \i0 \ul0 [*14]\b0 \i0 \ul0   limits voter choice at the general election." 462 F.3d at 192.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The other features of the judicial convention system cited below as contributing to an undue burden have previously been found constitutionally benign when standing alone. For example, this Court has repeatedly upheld more demanding signature requirements for ballot access than those at issue here--between 9,000 and 24,000 signatures over a 37-day period. See \b0 \i \ul0 Norman v. Reed,\b0 \i0 \ul0  502 U.S. 279, 295 (1992) ("our precedents foreclose the argument" that collecting 25,000 signatures from one suburban district is unduly burdensome); \b0 \i \ul0 Storer v. Brown,\b0 \i0 \ul0  415 U.S. 724, 740 (1974) ("[s]tanding alone, gathering 325,000 signatures in 24 days would not appear to be an impossible burden"); \b0 \i \ul0 White,\b0 \i0 \ul0  415 U.S. at 783 (22,000 signatures in 55 days "does not appear either impossible or impractical").
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Similarly, although this Court has not considered New York's practice of not including on the primary ballot the names of the candidate to whom a convention delegate has pledged his support, that practice has been sustained by a New York State court. See \b0 \i \ul0 Fallon v. State Bd. of Elections,\b0 \i0 \ul0  380 N.Y.S.2d 355 (N.Y. App. Div. 1976). \b \i0 \ul0 [**27]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 None of the other features of the convention statute was even claimed to be unconstitutional, much less found to be so. The requirement of a convention in the first instance is clearly permissible under \b0 \i \ul0 White.\b0 \i0 \ul0  The election of delegates in a primary and their distribution across all ADs are both features of candidate selection for other offices in New York that were cited with approval by the district court. 411 F. Supp. 2d at 220.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Without the cumulative effect of the delegate-allocation formulas discussed above, it is unlikely that the courts below would have found that the other features of  \b \i0 \ul0 [*15]\b0 \i0 \ul0   the convention system significantly burden First Amendment rights. n12

\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 n12 The other factual findings below, detailing the anecdotal difficulties of respondents in seeking office, are more accurately described as symptoms, not causes, of the severe burden discussed above. It is hardly surprising that the political bosses respondent Lopez Torres encountered--one of whom, Clarence Norman, has since been convicted on numerous felony corruption charges--were able to freeze her out of the convention process when her only alternative was to attempt to field a slate of 248 of her own delegates and alternates.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 3. Once the court below concluded that the delegate-allocation formulas could not stand, it was required to strike from the statute the \b0 \i \ul0 minimum\b0 \i0 \ul0  language necessary to remove those formulas, and then to ask "whether the legislature, if partial invalidity had been foreseen, would have wished the statute to be enforced with the invalid part exscinded, or rejected altogether." \b0 \i \ul0 Alpha Portland Cement,\b0 \i0 \ul0  129 N.E. at 207.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Striking the defective formulas from the statute here would have been remarkably easy because the formulas are not in the statute to begin with. The statute contains only a grant of authority to the political parties to create those formulas, not the formulas themselves. n13

The creation of the delegate-allocation formulas by the parties is nonetheless "state action" for constitutional purposes. See \b0 \i \ul0 Terry v. Adams,\b0 \i0 \ul0  345 U.S. 461, 481-482 (1953); \b0 \i \ul0 Smith v. Allwright,\b0 \i0 \ul0  321 U.S. 649, 663-664 (1944).

Furthermore, the fact that the specific formulas were put in place \b0 \i \ul0 after\b0 \i0 \ul0  the statute was enacted is compelling evidence of the statute's adequate  \b \i0 \ul0 [*16]\b0 \i0 \ul0   functionality in the absence of those formulas. Cf. \b0 \i \ul0 Skaneateles Waterworks,\b0 \i0 \ul0  55 N.E. at 566-567. Like the party affiliation requirement in \b0 \i \ul0 Schieffelin,\b0 \i0 \ul0  the delegate-allocation formulas "add[] nothing to and detract[] nothing from the purpose of the act." 170 N.E. at 908. n14

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Founded in 1909, the NAACP is the nation's oldest and largest civil rights organization. Its members throughout the United States and the world are the premiere advocates for civil rights in their communities, conducting voter mobilization and monitoring equal opportunity in \b \i0 \ul0 [**31]\b0 \i0 \ul0   the public and private sectors. The Mid-Manhattan Branch was founded in 1966.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 For over 40 years, the Mid-Manhattan NAACP has been an advocate for all its citizens in the struggle for civil rights and equality. Today, Mid-Manhattan NAACP plays an active role in confronting the gaps and disparities in health care, economics, education funding, criminal justice, and diversity in the courts and the judiciary.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Its efforts continue in voter education, registration and mobilization, as well as youth development and enrichment programs. Today, Mid-Manhattan NAACP has over 600 members, with seven working Committees (Education, Health, Fundraising, Legal Redress, Membership, Political Action and Youth Council).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Mid-Manhattan NAACP's past and present participation on the Supreme and Civil Court Judicial Screening Panels has contributed to greater diversity and minority participation on the Bench. The Branch has five sitting Supreme Court Justices (Hon. Carol L. Edmead, Hon. Milton A. Tingling, Hon. Doris Ling Cohen, Hon. Debra James, and Hon. Paul Fineman) and four sitting Civil Court Judges (Hon. George Silver, Hon. Tanya Kennedy, Hon. Margaret Chan, and Hon. Shari Michels) among its active \b \i0 \ul0 [**32]\b0 \i0 \ul0   members. These Judges all reported out of the Judicial Screening Panel process as highly qualified and are representative of the great diversity of New York County.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360  \b \i0 \ul0 [*2a]\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b \i0 \ul0 The Metropolitan Black Bar Association\b0 \i0 \ul0  ("MBBA") was created on July 5, 1984 upon the merger of two of the nation's oldest Black bar organizations, the Harlem Lawyers Association and the Bedford Stuyvesant Lawyers Association. For over sixty years, the Harlem Lawyers Association (founded 1921) and the Bedford Stuyvesant Lawyers Association (founded 1933) provided a voice for Black legal professionals and their communities. The MBBA proudly continues the rich legacy of these constituent organizations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Today, the MBBA is comprised of Black attorneys in both the public and private sectors, as well as judges and other public officials. The MBBA is an affiliate of the National Bar Association and is governed by a 22-member Board of Directors. Its daily operations are managed by its President and six additional elected officers. The purpose of the MBBA is to aid the progress of attorneys of color, and to assist the progress of the legal profession generally. The MBBA serves all of the counties of the Greater \b \i0 \ul0 [**33]\b0 \i0 \ul0   New York metropolitan area.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Throughout its 23-year history, MBBA has advocated equal justice and diversity contributing to increasing numbers of minorities in the judiciary. Its founding members include Hon. George Bundy Smith, former Associate Judge on the NYS Court of Appeals; Hon. Fern Fisher, Administrative Judge of the Civil Court of the City of New York; Hon. L. Priscilla Hall, NYS Supreme Court, Kings County; and Hon. Cheryl Chambers, NYS Supreme Court, Kings County.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The MBBA works to expand the breadth and scope of diverse social and legal issues programs for the benefit of the bar and bench as well as the community at large. MBBA has partnered with a number of other organizations to provide such programs, including the Mid-Manhattan Branch of the NAACP, the Asian American Bar Association, the Puerto Rican Bar Association, the Dominican Bar Association, the Jewish Lawyers Guild,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*3a]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Nigerian Lawyers' Association, New York County Lawyers Association, the Association of the Bar of the City of New York, the American Bar Association, the New York State Bar Association, NAACP Legal Defense Fund, law schools, and other institutions.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The MBBA sponsors lectures and seminars \b \i0 \ul0 [**34]\b0 \i0 \ul0   on Tax Amnesty, Haywood Burns Memorial, Affirmative Action, Immigration Law, Attorney Disciplinary Procedures, Criminal Justice, Jury Selection, Entertainment Law, Guardian/Receivership Training, Surrogate Court Practice and Procedure, Labor Law, Estate Planning and other matters. Members may also qualify for scholarships for continuing legal education courses.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Recently, the MBBA called for minority bar associations to jointly screen and interview judicial candidates to increase the strength of diversity. Other initiatives include: In December 2006, the Hon. George Bundy Lecture Series was established to be held annually in conjunction with the Association of the Bar of the City of New York and the Ida B. Wells Barnett Awards is held annually in conjunction with the New York County Lawyers Association and MBBA's expansive CLE program is held in partnership with the ABA and other minority bar groups.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Other activities include programs geared to potential and current law students and mentoring high school students. The Metropolitan Black Bar Association Scholarship Fund, Inc., an independent non-profit corporation, raises funds and grants scholarships to minority law students.
