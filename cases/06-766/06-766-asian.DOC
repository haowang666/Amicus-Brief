Pursuant to Rule 37.6, the \b0 \i \ul0 amicus curiae\b0 \i0 \ul0  discloses that no counsel for any party in this case authored this brief in whole or in part, and no person or entity, other than the \b0 \i \ul0 amicus curiae,\b0 \i0 \ul0  its members, or its counsel, made a monetary contribution to the preparation or submission of this brief.
\par \fs20 \b0 \i \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Amicus Curiae\b0 \i0 \ul0  Asian American Bar Association of New York ("AABANY") is a membership organization which represents the interests of approximately 4,000 Asian American attorneys in New York. Since its incorporation in 1989, AABANY has taken an active role in advocating and promoting diversity in the judiciary and has taken positions on legal issues that affect the access of Asian Americans and other minorities to the electoral process.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 AABANY filed briefs \b0 \i \ul0 amicus curiae\b0 \i0 \ul0  in this Court supporting petitioner's application for a writ of certiorari and in the Second Circuit seeking reversal of the district court decision on the grounds that the district court failed to narrowly tailor its injunctive relief to fit the purported constitutional infirmities set forth in its preliminary injunction decision. Because of the direct and negative impact that the remedy of judicial district-wide open primaries will have on Asian Americans, from both an ethnic diversity and an associational rights perspective, AABANY is in a unique position to aid this Court in understanding the issues presented by the petition, particularly with regard to the district court's improper remedy, which is a subsumed component of the first question presented by petitioners in the petition for a writ of certiorari.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  \b \i0 \ul0 [*2]\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b \i0 \ul0 INTRODUCTION\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This Court has previously held that "[i]t is too plain for argument . . . that the State may properly limit each political party to one candidate for each office on the ballot and may insist that intra party competition be settled before the general election by primary election or by party convention." \b0 \i \ul0 American Party of Texas v. White,\b0 \i0 \ul0  415 U.S. 767 (1974), citing, \b0 \i \ul0 Storer v. Brown,\b0 \i0 \ul0  415 U.S. 724, 733-736 (1974). New York State has chosen to have intra-party competition between candidates for its court of general jurisdiction, the New York State Supreme Court, settled in party conventions. Yet, by judicial fiat, the district court jettisoned New York's convention system in favor of the very system New York State intentionally chose \b0 \i \ul0 not\b0 \i0 \ul0  to adopt with regard to this office -- open primaries. With the stroke of a pen, the state judiciary is now burdened with the prospect of expensive campaigns for electoral office. In doing so, the courts below eviscerated the aspirations of Asian Americans \b \i0 \ul0 [**7]\b0 \i0 \ul0   to "meaningfully participate" in their own efforts to seek judicial office because Asian American candidates cannot raise the necessary funds or overcome ethnic bloc voting that is stacked against small minority groups all in the name of amorphously named so-called challenger candidates that by definition lacks support.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Remarkably, the courts below imposed this remedy on the basis of no fact-finding whatsoever. Rather, the courts below imposed an open primary system as a "default" and "interim" remedy, and in the process, swept aside New York's 90 year old convention system.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The courts below imposed this remedy even though the record contains little or no showing that the system is \b0 \i \ul0 structurally\b0 \i0 \ul0  deficient. And even if such structural  \b \i0 \ul0 [*3]\b0 \i0 \ul0   deficiencies had been shown, the courts below should have mended, not ended, the system. As this Court instructed in \b0 \i \ul0 Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New England,\b0 \i0 \ul0  546 U.S. 320 (2006), injunctive relief must be narrowly tailored to address the constitutional infirmities in question.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Second Circuit made clear that its standard applied even to "facially valid" convention systems. Petitioners' Appendix at 41 (hereinafter \b \i0 \ul0 [**8]\b0 \i0 \ul0   "Pet. App.    ."). As such, the rulings of the courts below amount to a frontal challenge to \b0 \i \ul0 American Party of Texas.\b0 \i0 \ul0  In contravention of \b0 \i \ul0 American Party of Texas,\b0 \i0 \ul0  the courts below legislated a requirement that the public be afforded direct and unmediated access to New York's judicial nomination process. The standard set by the courts below would expose a variety of existing nomination systems to the possibility of standardless judicial review. For example, the standard set by the courts below could put at risk such systems as the major parties' nomination process for presidential candidates, a process in which party leaders wield considerable and potentially decisive influence. And, taken to its logical conclusion, the rulings of the courts below raise the spectre that successful state-run screening panels would have to open their doors to the electorate if those screening panels serve as meaningful gatekeepers to judicial nominations. These results, which are antithetical to \b0 \i \ul0 American Party of Texas,\b0 \i0 \ul0  cannot stand.

\par \pard 
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The court \b \i0 \ul0 [**9]\b0 \i0 \ul0   of appeals and district court refused to correctly apply \b0 \i \ul0 Ayotte\b0 \i0 \ul0  and directed open primaries as an  \b \i0 \ul0 [*4]\b0 \i0 \ul0   "interim" remedy based upon a non-existent primary "default" provision supposedly contained in New York's election law. n2 Pet. App. 82 (discussing the purported "default" nature of Election Law \'a7 6-110); \b0 \i \ul0 id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 23 (noting that the district court enjoined conventions "[b]ased upon the provision of state election law providing for primary elections as the default nominating process. . . .").
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 n2 The courts below struck down Election Law \'a7\'a7 6-106 and \'a7 6-124 as unconstitutional. Election Law \'a7 6-106 pertains to party nominations for justices of the New York State Supreme Court. Election Law \'a7 6-124 contains the statutory procedures for judicial conventions. Pet. App. 186.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Yet, New York's election law contains no such "default" provision to open primaries for the office of New York State Supreme Court Justice. Rather, Election Law \'a7 6-110 specifically states that a primary election be used "\b0 \i \ul0 except as provided herein.\b0 \i0 \ul0 " Election Law \'a7 6-106, in turn, expressly provides that nominations for Supreme Court Justice will be by party convention. Thus, rather \b \i0 \ul0 [**10]\b0 \i0 \ul0   than providing for an open primary "default," Election Law \'a7 6-106 actually embodies the legislature's intention to have nominations for this elective office conducted by convention.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Based upon this mistaken reliance upon a non-existent default provision, the courts below imposed an open primary remedy with no fact-finding on the remedy issue. Such fact-finding would have disclosed that the "default" remedy is not warranted.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 First, because the record discloses no structural infirmity with the convention system, fact-finding may have revealed that the system could have been improved through more narrowly tailored remedies such as revision of signature requirements, timing, and the number of delegates at conventions.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360  \b \i0 \ul0 [*5]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Second, because of its suspect fact-finding, the courts below relied principally on the thesis that the convention system was flawed because party leaders tend to strongly influence the results. If this were the standard, it would call into question many convention systems, including those of the major national political parties.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Third, because the record focused, at most, on two judicial districts, the remedy ordered by the courts below should not have encompassed \b \i0 \ul0 [**11]\b0 \i0 \ul0   the entire state, but should, at most, have been confined to the two judicial districts that were the subject of the courts' fact-finding.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Fourth, the courts below should have taken into account the impact that open primary elections would have on the aspirations of minority candidates seeking judicial office. If the courts below had engaged in proper fact-finding, they would have taken into account the fact that a remedy of judicial district-wide partisan open primary elections has the grave potential of leading to a "tyranny of the majority" to the detriment of Asian Americans, one of the least powerful and most underre presented ethnic minorities in New York State. The existing nominating system, whatever its flaws, does not present Asian Americans with the same barriers that they may face in a partisan open primary election process. The latter process is one in which voting along ethnic lines would most likely prevail to the detriment of minority groups such as Asian Americans. Indeed, a partisan electoral process is one in which cash is king -- again an insuperable barrier to the aspirations of many Asian Americans who generally lack the resources and the political clout to raise \b \i0 \ul0 [**12]\b0 \i0 \ul0   the hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions of dollars, needed for judicial races in New York.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360  \b \i0 \ul0 [*6]\b0 \i0 \ul0   As a result of the demographic and fiscal challenges posed by a partisan open primary election system, Asian Americans have been virtually shut out of judgeships in the states where such systems prevail. Eight states, encompassing approximately 25% of the nation's population, have partisan election systems similar to the system that the courts below have imposed. n3 From the point of view of Asian Americans, the experiences of these eight states are striking: out of nearly 2,500 judges in those eight states, only \b0 \i \ul0 seven judges\b0 \i0 \ul0  are of Asian American descent. n4 A majority of the states with partisan open primary election systems have \b0 \i \ul0 no Asian American judges\b0 \i0 \ul0  whatsoever. n5

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 I. The Courts Below Failed To Properly Apply \b \i \ul0 Ayotte\b \i0 \ul0  Because They Applied Overly Broad Findings Of Fact To Justify An Overly Broad Remedy\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Although the Second Circuit acknowledged that "a convention-based system is, in the abstract, a perfectly acceptable method of nomination," Pet. App. 46, it  \b \i0 \ul0 [*7]\b0 \i0 \ul0   nonetheless struck down New York's convention system in its entirety with no explanation as to why the system was \b0 \i \ul0 structurally\b0 \i0 \ul0  flawed. At its core, the courts below struck down New York's system because that system tended to produce nominees supported by party leaders. However, as set forth below, such an indictment could be directed at many political convention systems and, as such, this is not an argument that goes to the structure of the New York system. Accordingly, this finding does not justify the remedy of striking down the entire system.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The courts below failed to heed this Court's direction that federal courts should not "nullify more of the legislature's work than is necessary." \b0 \i \ul0 Ayotte,\b0 \i0 \ul0  546 U.S. 320, 326. \b \i0 \ul0 [**14]\b0 \i0 \ul0   As this Court instructed, the "normal rule" is that "partial, rather than facial, invalidation is the required course," such that a "statute may . . . be declared invalid to the extent that it reaches too far, but otherwise left intact." \b0 \i \ul0 Ayotte,\b0 \i0 \ul0  546 U.S. 320, 329 (citing \b0 \i \ul0 Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  472 U.S. 491, 504 (1985)). Indeed, this Court has provided a clear admonition in the election law context that judicial remedies be narrowly tailored to avoid "reject[ing] state policy choices more than was necessary to meet the constitutional violations involved." \b0 \i \ul0 Upham v. Seamon,\b0 \i0 \ul0  456 U.S. 37, 42 (1982) (citing \b0 \i \ul0 Whitcomb v. Chavis,\b0 \i0 \ul0  403 U.S. 124, 160-161 (1971)). Thus, in cases such as \b0 \i \ul0 United States v. Booker,\b0 \i0 \ul0  543 U.S. 220 (2005), the Court took great pains to sever and excise only those portions of Title 18 of the United States Code that rendered the Sentencing Guidelines unconstitutional, while scrupulously leaving in place the applicability of the Guidelines to the federal sentencing scheme. Similarly, the courts  \b \i0 \ul0 [*8]\b0 \i0 \ul0   below should have used a like surgical technique by only excising any allegedly \b \i0 \ul0 [**15]\b0 \i0 \ul0   offending provision. n6

Valeo,\b0 \i0 \ul0  424 U.S. 1 (1976) (in order to save the statute from First Amendment infirmity, the Court engaged in an extensive re-interpretation of the statute, construing the statute as imposing independent reporting requirements on individuals and groups that are not candidates or political committees only in the following circumstances: (1) when they make contributions earmarked for political purposes or authorized or requested by a candidate or his agent, to some person other than a candidate or political committee, and (2) when they make expenditures for communications that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate).

\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In \b0 \i \ul0 Ayotte,\b0 \i0 \ul0  this Court explained that several interrelated principles support this limitation on judicial remedies.

\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0 "[W]e try not to nullify more of a legislature's work than is necessary, for we know that '[a] ruling of unconstitutionality frustrates the intent of the elected representatives \b \i0 \ul0 [**16]\b0 \i0 \ul0   of the people.' \b0 \i \ul0 Regan v.

\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0 Second, mindful that our constitutional mandate and institutional competence are limited, we restrain ourselves from 'rewrit[ing] state law to conform it to constitutional requirements' even as we strive to salvage it. \b0 \i \ul0 Virginia v.

\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0 Third, the touchstone for any decision about remedy is legislative intent, for a court cannot 'use its remedial powers to circumvent the intent of the legislature.' \b0 \i \ul0 Califano v. Wescott,\b0 \i0 \ul0  443 U.S. 76, 95 (1979)."

\par \b0 \i \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 See supra,\b0 \i0 \ul0  546 U.S. 320 at 329 (certain citations omitted).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360  \b \i0 \ul0 [*9]\b0 \i0 \ul0   The Second Circuit rationalized that the application of a less intrusive alternative to salvage judicial conventions from the purported constitutional defects would have been "inviting the District Court to act as a one-person legislature superchamber." Pet. App. 80. However, in what is purportedly an "interim" remedy, but in reality amounts to the imposition of a permanent injunction, the district court had no qualms in reducing the number \b \i0 \ul0 [**17]\b0 \i0 \ul0   of signatures required by Election Law \'a7 6-136 which would apply to the open primaries. Pet. App. 184. Thus, the rulings of the courts below are internally inconsistent. If it is permissible to amend the signature requirement, it should be equally permissible to "fix" other aspects of the convention system, rather than scrapping it altogether.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 If the Second Circuit had considered the various factors, it may have attempted to remedy the supposed constitutional infirmities by such carefully tailored remedies as ordering reductions in the number of signatures required on designating petitions, reduction of the number of delegates at the nominating conventions and/or expansion of the time New York State Supreme Court judicial candidates have to lobby delegates. These remedies would have addressed the fundamental criticisms of the convention process that were the focus of the Second Circuit's opinion. Pet. App. 14, 62-64 (signature requirements); Pet. App. 80 (number of delegates); Pet. App. 18, 80 (lack of time for lobbying).

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 A. The Courts Below Failed To Properly Apply \b \i \ul0 Ayotte\b \i0 \ul0  Because Of Their Misreading Of The New York State Election Law\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The courts below failed to narrowly \b \i0 \ul0 [**18]\b0 \i0 \ul0   tailor their relief because they misinterpreted New York's election law as  \b \i0 \ul0 [*10]\b0 \i0 \ul0   having a so-called default remedy. Pet. App. 82 (discussing the purported default nature of Election Law \'a7 6-110); \b0 \i \ul0 id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 23 (noting that the district court enjoined conventions "[b]ased upon the provision of state election law providing for primary elections as the default nominating process. . . ."). Nothing could be further from the truth. New York election law, far from defaulting to an open primary, clearly and unequivocally mandates that party nominations for the office of New York State Supreme Court Justice shall be conducted by party convention. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  Election Law \'a7 6-106. The statutory provision relied upon by the courts below, Election Law \'a7 6-110, when read in conjunction with the remainder of the election law and with the relevant provision of the New York State Constitution, clearly carves this office out of the provision calling for the use of open primaries for other offices. n7

Yet, the district court invalidated the applicability of this election law provision finding that "[i]t cannot be said, as the defendants assume, that the legislature intended N.Y. Elec.

The blunderbuss approach of the courts below flows from the nature of the fact-finding below. Had there been a full trial on the merits, the respondents would have to prove "beyond a reasonable doubt" that the challenged statutes are unconstitutional. \b0 \i \ul0 New Alliance Party v. New York State Bd. of Elec.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  861 F. Supp. 282, 292 (S.D.N.Y. 1994).

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 A close examination of the record highlights the vast difference of evidence produced at a preliminary injunction hearing as opposed to a full-blown trial. In this case, the application for the preliminary injunction was a technique  \b \i0 \ul0 [*13]\b0 \i0 \ul0   which enabled the plaintiffs in the district court proceeding to sidestep the evidentiary burdens, associated with a trial or summary judgment motion. The evidence was anecdotal, limited and redundant. The so-called voluminous "10,000-page preliminary record" which purportedly "establish[es] how the scheme functions" (Resp. Cert. Br. 2) consisted of copies of petition signatures, transcripts of judicial conventions throughout New York State, signature certifications, newspaper articles, some of them decades old, and even deposition transcripts from old unrelated cases, much of which was of little import and would probably have been inadmissible at a trial \b \i0 \ul0 [**23]\b0 \i0 \ul0   bound by rules of evidence. n9 The respondents called few witnesses in support of their contention about the unconstitutionality of the convention system. \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  Appendix 1. The so-called "evidence" simply does not support a sweeping statewide remedy. The courts below appear to have inferred that the  \b \i0 \ul0 [*14]\b0 \i0 \ul0   problems encountered in a few counties or districts apply statewide. Testimonies of the petitioners' defense witnesses, many of whom were elected New York State Supreme Court Justices, were marginalized and, in some cases, completely disregarded as the district court relied on a handful of witnesses when it displaced the will of the legislature.

Such hearsay included: (1) news articles, many of which were opinion pieces and over a decade old (HE-4981-87 (Exs. 70-74); (2) documents with embedded hearsay, such as reports containing anonymous conclusions regarding conventions (HE-4988-5419, 5685-762 (Exs. 77-79, 90)); (3) the ten year-old transcript of Farrell's testimony from another case, from which the district court apparently made credibility determinations (SPA 33-35; HE-5960-6421 (Ex. 98); \b0 \i \ul0 see\b0 \i0 \ul0  Tr. 123-124; 1151; 1156-1163); and (4) impermissible opinion testimony (Tr. 30:8-19, 38:23-24; SPA 21-22). Although this evidence was inadmissible, \b0 \i \ul0 e.g., \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Tasini v. New York Times Co.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  184 F.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The rulings of the district court were rendered in a preliminary injunction hearing on a record that the parties did not believe would provide the basis for permanent injunctive relief. Pet. App. 77. This Court has correctly cautioned that findings in the preliminary injunctive context are inherently different from those needed for permanent relief. This Court has ruled that findings of "likelihood of success on the merits" are not "tantamount to decisions on the underlying merits"; the two are "significantly different." \b0 \i \ul0 University of Texas v. Camenisch,\b0 \i0 \ul0  451 U.S. 390, 393-394 (1981).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The courts below did not heed the admonition of \b0 \i \ul0 Camenisch\b0 \i0 \ul0  and instead relied on the hearsay and anecdotal evidence adduced in the preliminary injunction hearing, without requiring the rigors of a full \b0 \i \ul0 evidentiary\b0 \i0 \ul0  trial on the merits. As a result, the district court's holding that a "realistic opportunity to participate" was denied rests almost entirely on the contention that the system should be invalidated because "county leaders . . . actually wield enormous and dispositive power in the process by which Justices of the Supreme Court are selected", delegates generally follow \b \i0 \ul0 [**25]\b0 \i0 \ul0   the wishes of their local district leader, and district leaders, in turn, generally follow the wishes of their county leader. Pet. App. 135. The courts below made this finding even though they acknowledged "that no  \b \i0 \ul0 [*15]\b0 \i0 \ul0   delegate testified to receiving express instructions on how to vote." Pet. App. 66.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 It is, of course, not uncommon for delegates at political conventions to follow the lead of party insiders. If the clout of political leaders is the principal basis for judicial attack on a nomination system, the court of appeal's ruling could jeopardize an array of political conventions. For example, party leaders who are \b0 \i \ul0 not\b0 \i0 \ul0  elected through primaries make up over 800 delegates at the Democratic National Convention. These so-called superdelegates, who include Democratic members of Congress, governors and state party chairmen, will account for nearly 40% of the votes needed to clinch the nomination. n10 As one political source put it:

Pet. App. 132. Remarkably, far from finding that the situation in the First Judicial District rose to the level of unacceptably unconstitutional atrocity, the district court held that the nomination process in the First Judicial District is characterized by "a measure of quality control that is unmatched in the state."

Aside from a citation to hearsay (Pet. App. 136 n.32), the discussion of the Second Judicial District focuses almost entirely on the travails of named plaintiff Margarita Lopez Torres (Pet. App. 136-143). Likewise the discussion of the Fourth District centers on Justice Joseph Sise (Pet. App. 143-145) to the exclusion of virtually anything else. And the analysis of the Seventh District relies heavily on the experience of John Regan. Pet. App. 146-147. Such anecdotes demonstrate, at most, that the convention system has failed in three particular instances which are scattered over a decade and provide little basis for a sweeping invalidation of the entire convention system.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360  \b \i0 \ul0 [*19]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Such fact-finding may well have shown that convention systems promote the interests of diversity. n17 By way of example, pure convention systems, largely not influenced by primary elections, resulted in the nominations of the first Catholics ever nominated to national tickets (Al Smith, 1928, and John Kennedy, 1960), the first woman ever nominated on a national ticket (Geraldine Ferraro, 1984), and the first Jewish candidate on a national ticket (Joe Lieberman, 2000). Ferraro and Lieberman were nominated as vice presidential candidates, for which no primary votes were cast. In contrast, since the advent of primaries as the principal basis for selecting presidential nominees only white Protestant males have been nominated by the national conventions of both parties. n18 This example of the national party conventions demonstrates that, at minimum, further fact-finding was warranted as to whether the interests of diversity are better served by a convention system as opposed to open primaries.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 (Tr. 1223:8-21).

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In the district court proceeding, New York State Senator Martin Connor also attested to the strength of bloc voting in New York, testifying that, in an open primary in the Second Judicial District, "you could not elect an Italian American, an Irish American, maybe have a hard time with \b \i0 \ul0 [**34]\b0 \i0 \ul0   a Latino." (Tr. 2124:4-2125:4). \b0 \i \ul0 See also\b0 \i0 \ul0  Testimony of Dennis Ward (Tr. 343:23-344:1) (stating that, in the Eighth Judicial District, no ethnic minorities would ever win a party nomination in an open primary system).

For example, in 1995, only 20% of all eligible Asian American voters in Flushing, Queens, were registered to vote. n24 And whites have a voting rate  \b \i0 \ul0 [*23]\b0 \i0 \ul0   nearly double that of Asian Americans. n25 Perhaps because of such factors, even as their numbers have increased, Asian Americans have not attained commensurate political clout. In Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco, the three cities with the highest populations of Asian Pacific Americans, Asian Pacific Americans hold only one out of a total of seventy-seven city council seats elected by singleseat districts n26 in these three cities. Strikingly, no Chinese American city council member has ever been elected in the Manhattan City \b \i0 \ul0 [**37]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Council District that encompasses Chinatown. n27 Until recently, a Queens district with a more than 30% Asian American population was represented by a city councilwoman who described the influx of Asian Americans as "an invasion, not an assimilation" and described Asian Americans as "more like colonizers than immigrants." n28

Asian Americans are, of course, a significant part of that diversity. The district court, however, did not adequately consider, and failed to  \b \i0 \ul0 [*24]\b0 \i0 \ul0   protect, that interest in diversity when it imposed its remedy. The district court also failed to take into account the associational rights of minorities, such as Asian Americans, to organize and participate within the political parties of their choosing and within that party's chosen method of nominating judicial candidates -- a process that Dr. Hechter described as logrolling. Those associational rights are, themselves, a compelling state interest, which was sufficient to uphold the convention system. Simply put, the district court did not, as it claimed, impose "the least intrusive course" when it directed open primaries. Pet. App. 183-184.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 What makes the New York State Supreme Court different from other courts within the state is the vast scope of its jurisdiction over subject matter in \b \i0 \ul0 [**39]\b0 \i0 \ul0   law and equity and its unlimited monetary jurisdiction. n29 N.Y. Const. art. VI, \'a7 7[a]. There is a great deal at stake, especially financially and especially within the major urban and suburban judicial districts, in which there are large, long-standing, well-established social, financial and commercial interest and in which most Asian Americans in the state are located. The inherent unseemly nature of raising large sums of money to fund expensive campaigns  \b \i0 \ul0 [*25]\b0 \i0 \ul0   for judicial races, particularly for sitting New York State Supreme Court justices, threatens the independence of the judiciary. This was apparent to the New York State Legislature in 1921 when it rejected the direct open primary system it had enacted in 1911 by enacting the convention system which is currently in place. Pet. App. 9.

Justices who serve in the New York State Supreme Court also control most of the court appointments of attorneys and other professionals in civil and criminal matters as well as setting the fees and reimbursements for expenses for those appointees.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The expense of a partisan open primary system may also adversely affect the prospect of a diverse judiciary. There is every reason to believe that, as stated in the Final Report to the Chief Judge of the State of New York of the Commission to Promote Public Confidence in Judicial Elections (the "Feerick Commission"), "primaries pose a great risk of attracting substantial increases in partisan spending on New York State judicial campaigns, which, as our research shows, would serve to further undermine confidence in the judiciary." n30 The negative impact of prohibitively expensive district-wide judicial open primaries would affect Asian Americans as their population concentration is within the New York City metropolitan area -- the most expensive media market in the country. n31

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Assuming that it was proper for the district court to refrain from following \b0 \i \ul0 Ayotte\b0 \i0 \ul0  and \b0 \i \ul0 Booker\b0 \i0 \ul0  and thereby striking the entire convention statutes, it was improper for the courts below to impose \b0 \i \ul0 new\b0 \i0 \ul0  state action in the form of open primaries as a core power reserved for the states in the United States Constitution in determining the time, place and manner of the election of state officers. \b0 \i \ul0 See, e.g., \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Burdick v. Takushi,\b0 \i0 \ul0  504 U.S. 428, 433 (1992), citing, \b0 \i \ul0 Sugarman v. Dougall,\b0 \i0 \ul0  413 U.S. 534, 647 (1973) ("States retain the power to regulate their own elections."). Rather \b \i0 \ul0 [**47]\b0 \i0 \ul0   then proceed cautiously so as not to trespass on the constitutional prerogative of New York State, the district court mandated open primaries upon New York State baldly stating that it would have been "irresponsible" for it to have "left such a gaping hole in the State's electoral scheme," Pet. App. 82. Its conclusion, however, rests on the flawed assumption that party nominations require state regulation. New York's political parties used nominating conventions between the years 1846 to 1911, notwithstanding the absence of any statute mandating  \b \i0 \ul0 [*30]\b0 \i0 \ul0   their use. n44 Pet. App. 6. In the absence of state law directing parties to nominate their candidates for this office in a specific way, it was the prerogative of parties to create internal rules, which ethnic minorities could have assisted in shaping, to determine the process of nominating candidates for New York State Supreme Court Justice rather than -- as we have here -- a judicially-imposed method of open primaries.
