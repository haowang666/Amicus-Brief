\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Whether intentional and invidious discrimination by federal officials, in incarcerating black Haitian refugees in prisons and detention camps on the basis of their race and national origin, is wholly immune from constitutional scrutiny under the equal protection guarantee of the Fifth Amendment.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This brief is submitted on behalf of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Inc. (NAACP); the National Conference of Black Lawyers (NCBL); the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC); the following Members of Congress, who are members of the Haitian Refugee Task Force of the Congressional Black Caucus -- Representative Walter E. Fauntroy (Chairman), Representative George W. Crockett, Jr., Representative Major R. Owens, and Representative Edolphus Towns; and Representative Mervin M. Dymally, who is Chairman of the Caribbean Task Force of the Caucus.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The NAACP is a non-profit corporation serving approximately 500,000 members nationwide, whose objectives include the achievement of equal rights and the elimination of racial discrimination.  The NCBL is a non-profit national membership organization comprised of black attorneys, among whose goals is the elimination of invidious discrimination from law and public policy.  SCLC is a non-profit membership organization dedicated to the achievement and protection of civil rights for all minorities.  The NAACP, NCBL, and SCLC are interested in this case because of the effects of invidious discrimination on black Haitians, and because the decision below also threatens minority citizens by eroding the principle that the Constitution universally condemns invidious race discrimination.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 As members of the Haitian Refugee and Caribbean Task Forces of the Congressional Black Caucus, the congressional amici are concerned with eliminating discriminatory Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) practices aimed at Haitians, many of whom have sought refuge in their districts.  As Members of Congress, these amici have a compelling interest in the availability of judicial review to ensure that executive agencies implement legslation, including the immigration laws, consistently with the Constitution.  Their interest is particularly compellng where, as in this case, INS personnel contravened legislative policy condemning the use of racial criteria in the immigration context.  n1

\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 REASONS FOR GRANTING THE WRIT
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 INS officials intentionally discriminated against petitioners, black Haitian refugees, on the basis of their race and \b \i0 \ul0 [*4]\b0 \i0 \ul0   national origin, by singling them out from other admission applicants for prolonged incarceration in remote federal prisons and detention camps.  \b0 \i \ul0 Jean v. Nelson,\b0 \i0 \ul0  711 F.2d 1455, 1501 (11th Cir. 1983) (App. A-35 to A-81).  n2 In fact, the INS was well aware when it resumed detention of excludable aliens in the early 1980's that the detention camps would largely be filled by black Haitians.  n3 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n2 These factual findings were not questioned by the court sitting \b0 \i \ul0 en banc.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n3 Plaintiffs' Exhibits (Pl. Ex.) 71A, 71B.  The Attorney General realized that the policy ultimately adopted would inevitably be recognized as establishing "concentration camps" for black Haitians.  Pl. Ex. 71A at 36th page (Memorandum of Attorney General, May 19, 1981).
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The evidence of intentional discrimination in the incarceration of black Haitians was largely unrebutted, except by the government's "mere protestation." \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 1494 (App. A-74).  A "plethora" of evidence demonstrated that INS officials specifically targeted Haitians for detention.  \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 1490 (App. A-70).  As a result, black Haitians were incarcerated with far greater frequency than were \b \i0 \ul0 [*5]\b0 \i0 \ul0   all other aliens.  \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 1488 (App. A-68).  Once incarcerated, Haitians generally were kept in detention for prolonged periods while other aliens either were detained temporarily at the port of entry or paroled n4 pending their exclusion hearings.  \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 1484-1502 (App. A-67 to A-82).  Unlike aliens of other nationalities or races, petitioners were separated from their families and shipped to remote detention centers in what the district court described as a "human shell game." \b0 \i \ul0 Louis v. Meissner,\b0 \i0 \ul0  530 F. Supp. 924, 926 (S.D. Fla. 1981) (App. A-144, A-146).  At many of these isolated camps, medical facilities were inadequate and immigration counsel was unavailable.  n5 Petitioners were held in substandard facilities or otherwise subjected to conditions considerably harsher than those faced by most non-Haitian detainees.  n6 Some were physically abused or deprived of necessary medical care.  n7

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Eleventh Circuit ruled that this invidious discrimination violated the equal protection guarantee of the Fifth Amendment.  \b0 \i \ul0 Jean v. Nelson,\b0 \i0 \ul0  711 F.2d at 1487-1502 (App. A-67 to A-82).  The court then granted a rehearing \b0 \i \ul0 en banc.\b0 \i0 \ul0  Without questioning the panel's findings of intentional and invidious race and national origin discrimination, the court ruled that those facts were of no constitutional consequence because the Constitution places no restrictions whatsoever on the government's incarceration of an alien pending a hearing on admission.  \b0 \i \ul0 Jean v. Nelson,\b0 \i0 \ul0  727 F.2d 957, 975 (11th Cir. 1984) (App. A-1, A-19).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The sole question which this Court is asked to address is whether invidious race and national origin discrimination in the incarceration of excludable aliens is wholly immune from constitutional scrutiny under the equal protection guarantee of the Fifth Amendment.  n8 This Court should grant the writ for two compelling reasons.  First, since the post-Civil War constitutional amendments, no court other than the court below has held under any circumstances that the government's incarceration of a person on the basis of his race or national \b \i0 \ul0 [*7]\b0 \i0 \ul0   origin was immune from all constitutional scrutiny.  The practical import of the question presented could not be greater, since it involves a serious deprivation of liberty, under circumstances that are lamentably capable of repetition.  Second, the Eleventh Circuit decision conflicts with well-established constitutional principles dictating that the discriminatory conduct of INS officials in this case is subject to constitutional review.  This Court should resolve this conflict among the circuits and with this Court's decisions, and decide "an important question of federal law which has not been, but should be, settled by this Court." Supreme Court Rule 17.1(a) & (c). 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n8 The ruling as to which review is sought does not involve petitioners' rights, whether procedural or substantive, with respect to their admission to this country.  In particular, petitioners do not challenge before this Court the premise that the Constitution limits neither the grounds on which an alien seeking initial admission may be excluded, nor the procedures employed in making that determination.  Nor would review of this case require an assessment of the \b0 \i \ul0 level\b0 \i0 \ul0  of scrutiny mandated by the Constitution, or the applicability or scope of any constitutional guarantees other than equal protection.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 I.  UNTIL THE DECISION BELOW, NO RULING SINCE THE CIVIL WAR HAS HELD UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S DEPRIVATION OF A PERSON'S PHYSICAL LIBERTY ON THE BASIS OF HIS RACE OR NATIONAL ORIGIN WAS IMMUNE FROM CONSTITUTIONAL SCRUTINY.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Not since the Dred Scott decision n9 has this Court indicated under any circumstances that the government could deprive a person of physical liberty on the basis of his race or national origin, wholly free from constitutional scrutiny.  Nor has any other court ever held that invidiously discriminatory incarceration is immune from all constitutional review -- until the decision below.  Indeed, it appears that neither this Court nor any other court has held invidious racial discrimination to be immune from constitutional scrutiny when impinging on \b0 \i \ul0 any\b0 \i0 \ul0  kind of liberty interest, except the privilege of being admitted to the country, which is not at stake here.  n10

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 No principle is more firmly established in our law, or more fundamental to our nation's values, than that race discrimination has no place in our government.  \b \i0 \ul0 [*9]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Our nation's repudiation of invidious race and national origin discrimination is reflected in the equal protection guarantee of the Fifty and Fourteenth Amendments, which subjects the use of race and national origin criteria to "the most rigid scrutiny." \b0 \i \ul0 Korematsu v. United States,\b0 \i0 \ul0  323 U.S. 214, 216 (1944). Invidious discrimination by the INS on the basis of race and nationality is also squarely condemned by congressional policy.  n11 The over-whelming importance of the nondiscrimination principle, and the utterly unprecedented nature of the decision below, demand that this Court grant review to determine whether the invidious incarceration of petitioners on the basis of their race is wholly beyond constitutional scrutiny. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n11 In 1965, Congress abolished the national origin quota system and special immigration restrictions relating to Orientals, and forbade discrimination based on race, sex, nationality, place of birth, or place of residence in all immigration matters.  Act of Oct. 3, 1965, P.L. 89-236, 76 Stat. 911; 8 U.S.C. \'a7 1152(a) (1982).
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 II.  THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT'S DECISION CONFLICTS WITH THE PRECEDENTS OF THIS AND OTHER COURTS,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*10]\b0 \i0 \ul0   WHICH DEMONSTRATE THAT THE INCARCERATION OF ALIENS ON THE BASIS OF THEIR RACE AND NATIONAL ORIGIN IS SUBJECT TO CONSTITUTIONAL SCRUTINY, WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER THEY HAVE "ENTERED" THE COUNTRY.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 A.  The Fifth Amendment Requires Equal Protection Whenever the Federal Government Deprives a Person of Life, Liberty or Property, Without Regard to the Victim's Citizenship or Whether the Deprivation Occurred Within the Country.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Eleventh Circuit's holding that the action of INS functionaries in incarcerating petitioners on the basis of race is beyond constitutional scrutiny is fundamentally at odds with the principle that "[t]he Constitution of the United States . . . covers with the shield of its protection all classes of men, at all times, and under all circumstances." \b0 \i \ul0 Ex Parte Milligan,\b0 \i0 \ul0  71 U.S. (4 Wal.) 2, 120-121 (1866). No circumstance of this case -- including the nature of the governmental action, the citizenship of its victims, and the fact that petitioners had not been officially "admitted" to the country at the time of the action -- justifies a departure from that basic principle.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments require that the government afford \b \i0 \ul0 [*11]\b0 \i0 \ul0   due process, including equal protection, whenever it deprives a person of "life, liberty, or property." U.S. Const., Amend. V. & XIV, \'a7 1.  The requirement is nowhere more clearly in play than when the government deprives a person of his freedom of movement.  \b0 \i \ul0 See, e.g., \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Addington v. Texas,\b0 \i0 \ul0  441 U.S. 418 (1979) (civil commitment).  In this case, petitioners challenge their incarceration in federal prisons and detention camps on the basis of race, a form of government action to which the Constitution clearly applies.  \b0 \i \ul0 See \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Korematsu v. United States,\b0 \i0 \ul0  323 U.S. at 216 (detention of Japanese Americans in "relocation centers").
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Foreign nationals as well as United States citizens are protected by the Fifth Amendment.  The clause expressly protects all "persons," making no reference to citizenship.  \b0 \i \ul0 See, e.g., \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Russian Volunteer Fleet v. United States,\b0 \i0 \ul0  282 U.S. 481 (1931) (alien outside the United States entitled to just compensatioon for taking of property).  Thus, this Court has long held that aliens are "persons" entitled to equal protection under both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  \b0 \i \ul0 Yick Wo v. Hopkins,\b0 \i0 \ul0  118 U.S. 356, 368 (1886) \b \i0 \ul0 [*12]\b0 \i0 \ul0   ("The rights of the petitioners, as affected by the proceedings of which they complain, are not less, because they are aliens and subjects of the Emperor of China."); \b0 \i \ul0 see also \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Plyler v. Doe,\b0 \i0 \ul0  457 U.S. 202, 212 (1982) ("Whatever his status under the immigration laws, an alien is surely a 'person' . . . [protected by the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments]"); \b0 \i \ul0 Mathews v. Diaz,\b0 \i0 \ul0  426 U.S. 67, 77 (1976); \b0 \i \ul0 Graham v. Richardson,\b0 \i0 \ul0  403 U.S. 365, 371 (1971).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This and other courts have recognized that governmental incarceration of all aliens is subject to constitutional scrutiny.  In \b0 \i \ul0 Wong Wing v. United States,\b0 \i0 \ul0  163 U.S. 228 (1896), this Court reviewed and struck down a statute authorizing administrative officials to imprison Chinese nationals found to be in this country illegally, holding that they could not be deprived of liberty without due process.  \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 238. Similarly, the Tenth Circuit has indicated that due process protections are applicable "when imprisonment [of an alien facing exclusion] is for an indefinite period, continued beyond reasonable efforts to expel the alien."  \b \i0 \ul0 [*13]\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b0 \i \ul0 Rodriguez-Fernandez v. Wilkinson,\b0 \i0 \ul0  654 F.2d 1382, 1387 (10th Cir. 1981). \b0 \i \ul0 Accord, Diaz v. Haig,\b0 \i0 \ul0  No. C81-235B (D. Wyo. September 3, 1981).  An excludable alien also may not be incarcerated as the result of a criminal conviction unless the strictures of the Fifth Amendment have been met.  \b0 \i \ul0 E.g., \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Wong Wing,\b0 \i0 \ul0  163 U.S. 228; \b0 \i \ul0 United States v. Henry,\b0 \i0 \ul0  604 F.2d 908, 914 (5th Cir. 1979); \b0 \i \ul0 United States v. Casimiro-Benitez,\b0 \i0 \ul0  533 F.2d 1121 (9th Cir.), \b0 \i \ul0 cert. denied,\b0 \i0 \ul0  429 U.S. 926 (1976).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Constitutional protections apply regardless of whether the person deprived of liberty is -- or is deemed to be -- inside the country, outside it, or "at the border." \b0 \i \ul0 See, e.g., \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Reid v. Covert,\b0 \i0 \ul0  354 U.S. 1, 7 (1957) (plurality opinion); \b0 \i \ul0 Balzac v. Porto Rico,\b0 \i0 \ul0  258 U.S. 298, 312-13 (1922). n12 Thus, for example, aliens are protected from unreasonable searches and seizures even if the challenged intrusion occurs outside the United States.  \b0 \i \ul0 United States v. Demanett,\b0 \i0 \ul0  629 F.2d 862 (3d Cir. 1980) (Colombian nationals subjected to a search on board ship), \b0 \i \ul0 cert. denied,\b0 \i0 \ul0  450 U.S. 910 (1981); \b \i0 \ul0 [*14]\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b0 \i \ul0 United States v. Toscanino,\b0 \i0 \ul0  500 F.2d 267, 280 (2d Cir. 1974) (Italian national kidnapped and subjected to wiretapping abroad).  Similarly, constitutional procedural rights were held applicable in a criminal trial of aliens conducted overseas by a United States court.  \b0 \i \ul0 United States v. Tiede,\b0 \i0 \ul0  86 F.R.D. 227 (U.S. Ct. for Berlin 1979).  Finally, it has been held that aliens stopped at the border by immigration officials receive the protection of the Fifth Amendment, including the privilege against self-incrimination.  \b0 \i \ul0 Henry,\b0 \i0 \ul0  604 F.2d at 914; \b0 \i \ul0 see also \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Casimiro-Benitez,\b0 \i0 \ul0  533 F.2d 1121. Thus, even if one treats petitioners as if they were outside the United States or "stopped at the border," there is no basis for concluding that their incarceration is exempt from constitutional scrutiny. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n12 A narrow exception applies where the interest at stake is merely the privilege of being in the country, in which case constitutional restrictions are inapplicable to those who have not already effected an "entry." \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  section II.B, pp. 10-13 \b0 \i \ul0 infra.\b0 \i0 \ul0  Deprivations of physical liberty, however, fall within the general rule rather than the limited exclusion decision exception.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The decision below also conflicts with the Tenth Circuit's rejection of the government's contention in \b0 \i \ul0 Nguyen Da Yen v. Kissinger,\b0 \i0 \ul0  528 F.2d 1194 (10th Cir. 1975) that its actions under the parole statute are beyond constitutional review.  The court held that the Attorney General's discretionary decisions with respect to paroling excludable aliens are not immune from constitutional scrutiny under the due process clause.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 B.  The Entry Doctrine Applies to the Exclusion of Aliens and Not to Their Incarceration.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Eleventh Circuit rested its unprecedented decision on a fundamental misconception of the "entry doctrine." That doctrine provides that aliens who have not "entered" the United States have no constitutional protection with respect to their admission.  It has never been applied to invidious discrimination in incarceration, and its rationale has no relevance to incarceration.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 To assess the scope of the entry doctrine, one must understand its origin and function.  This Court has held that the power to regulate immigration is an essential attribute of sovereignty.  \b0 \i \ul0 Nishimura Ekiu v. United States,\b0 \i0 \ul0  142 U.S. 651 (1982); \b0 \i \ul0 The Chinese Exclusion Case,\b0 \i0 \ul0  130 U.S. 581 (1889). \b \i0 \ul0 [*16]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Accordingly, the political branches of government have broad discretion in controlling the nation's borders, including complete discretion to select criteria for the initial admission of an alien, and to establish procedures by which those criteria will be applied.  \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  Once an alien has entered the country, however, he may not be expelled or denied re-admission without the benefit of certain constitutional protections.  n13 \b0 \i \ul0 See, e.g., \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Kwong Hai Chew v. Colding,\b0 \i0 \ul0  344 U.S. 590, 600 (1953); \b0 \i \ul0 The Japanese Immigrant Case,\b0 \i0 \ul0  189 U.S. 86 (1903). The rule that the applicability of constitutional protections to admission depends upon whether the alien has "entered" the United States is known as the "entry doctrine." 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n13 The Immigration and Nationality Act provides that an alien awaiting a decision on admission can either be detained or temporarily paroled (\b0 \i \ul0 i.e.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  released) until his hearing.  8 U.S.C. \'a7 1182(d) (5)(A) (1982).  An alien who is detained within the country or released pending the admission decision is deemed not to have entered for the purpose of the entry doctrine.  The consequence of this fiction is that he stands on the same footing with respect to his admission -- \b0 \i \ul0 i.e.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  lacking constitutional protection -- as when he was first stopped at the border.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  \b \i0 \ul0 [*17]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This case does not involve admission, but the alien's right not to be deprived of physical liberty on grounds of race or national origin.  Therefore, the function of the entry doctrine is not implicated.  For the purpose of the present petition, petitioners do not assert a right to admission, nor any procedural rights with respect to the admission decision.  They seek only temporary release from custody pending determination of admissibility.  Parole will have no effect on their rights with respect to admission, for those detained and those paroled stand in exactly the same shoes.  \b0 \i \ul0 Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei,\b0 \i0 \ul0  345 U.S. 206, 213 (1953); \b0 \i \ul0 Kaplan v. Tod,\b0 \i0 \ul0  267 U.S. 228 (1925). Thus, petitioners' challenge to racial and national origin discrimination in incarceration does not, even indirectly, put in question the political branches' plenary authority over admission.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Consistent with the entry doctrine's purpose, this Court has applied it only in cases involving an alien's admission.  In no other instance have an excludable alien's rights been held limited by the entry doctrine.  Thus, in its most recent description of the doctrine, this \b \i0 \ul0 [*18]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Court took pains to emphasize that "an [excludable] alien . . . has no constitutional rights \b0 \i \ul0 regarding his application [for admission]." \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Landon v. Plasencia,\b0 \i0 \ul0  459 U.S. 21, 32 (1982) (emphasis added).  The Court was careful not to suggest that excludable aliens lack constitutional protection in any other context.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This Court's precedents are consistent with the limited scope of the entry doctrine described in \b0 \i \ul0 Landon.\b0 \i0 \ul0  In the seminal entry doctrine case, \b0 \i \ul0 Nishimura Ekiu,\b0 \i0 \ul0  142 U.S. 651 (1892), the Court addressed the question of the process due to an excludable alien who was allowed to disembark and remain in the country briefly pending a determination of her admissibility.  The Court held that unadmitted aliens are due only that process granted by Congress and Executive officials acting within the scope of their delegated powers.  \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 660. Nothing in the Court's opinion suggests that plenary congressional authority with respect to admission standards and procedures has any bearing on constitutional rights applicable to aliens in any other context.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The distinction between the rights of admitted and unadmitted aliens was clarified \b \i0 \ul0 [*19]\b0 \i0 \ul0   in \b0 \i \ul0 Kwong Hai Chew v. Colding,\b0 \i0 \ul0  344 U.S. 590 (1953). The Court held that the exclusion of a resident alien without notice of the charges against him violated the Fifth Amendment.  However, the Court indicated that the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment would not protect an excludable alien in exclusion proceedings.  n14 \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 600. The Court did not address the applicability of constitutional protections with respect to actions other than exclusion.  n15 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n14 The Court applied this principle in \b0 \i \ul0 Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei,\b0 \i0 \ul0  345 U.S. 206 (1953). The Court also applied the entry fiction, holding that Mezei's presence on Ellis Island did not afford him rights greater than before he debarked.  As in the other cited cases, the Court neither addressed race discrimination nor suggested that aliens awaiting an exclusion determination lack constitutional protection with respect to incarceration.  \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  section III.A, pp. 13-16 \b0 \i \ul0 infra.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n15 In one broad passage, the Court stated that "excludable aliens . . . are . . . not within the protection of the Fifth Amendment." \b0 \i \ul0 Kwong Hai Chew,\b0 \i0 \ul0  344 U.S. at 600. It is clear from the context, however, that the Court was addressing the protections applicable in an exclusion proceeding, and did not purport to suggest, much less hold, that protections are lacking in other areas.  Indeed, such a suggestion would have been flatly inconsistent with holdings recognizing that aliens are protected by the Constitution.  \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  section II.A, pp. 7-10, \b0 \i \ul0 supra.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  \b \i0 \ul0 [*20]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In sum, the rationale of the entry doctrine is inapplicable to this case.  The cases in which it has been applied stand in stark contrast to this and other cases in which excludable aliens assert the violation of constitutional rights by official actions other than exclusion or exclusion procedures.  In those cases, reviewed in section II.A, the entry doctrine is entirely ignored, n16 or mentioned only by way of pointing out its inapplicability.  n17 The Supreme Court should grant review to resolve the conflict between the Eleventh Circuit's unprecedented and expansive view of the entry doctrine and the narrower concept embodied in the decisions of the other lower courts and this Court.

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 III.  THE RATIONALES RELIED UPON BY THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT CANNOT WITHSTAND ANALYSIS.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 A.  The Court Below Rested Its Holding on a Fundamental Misreading of \b0 \i \ul0 Shaughnessy v. United\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b \i0 \ul0 [*21]\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b0 \i \ul0  States ex rel. Mezei.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Eleventh Circuit declined to perform an independent assessment of the applicability of equal protection to the incarceration of an excludable alien pending an exclusion decision because it believed the issue was resolved definitively in \b0 \i \ul0 Mezei.\b0 \i0 \ul0  n18 \b0 \i \ul0 Jean,\b0 \i0 \ul0  727 F.2d at 974-75 (App. A-18 to A-19).  That ruling represents a fundamental misreading of this Court's opinion. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n18 While finding the result "compelled" by \b0 \i \ul0 Mezei,\b0 \i0 \ul0  the court was moved to point out that decision has been "heavily criticized." \b0 \i \ul0 Jean,\b0 \i0 \ul0  727 F.2d at 971 (App. A-15).
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 After Mezei arrived at Ellis Island, the INS determined that he posed a security threat.  It ordered him excluded without a hearing, pursuant to emergency regulations which Congress had authorized for times of war or a declared national emergency.  While awaiting deportation, Mezei filed a habeas corpus petition challenging his continued exclusion and seeking permission to go to the mainland.  The relief sought would have amounted to an indefinite admission, even if styled as "temporary" parole pending deportation, because no nation contacted by Mezei or the INS would accept him.  Most \b \i0 \ul0 [*22]\b0 \i0 \ul0   of the Court's opinion was devoted to establishing that Mezei could be excluded without a hearing.  Although he had debarked, he was deemed not to have "entered" the United States and thus had no right to due process with respect to his admission.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In the penultimate paragraph, the Court reiterated that Mezei's debarkation could not create additional rights because both aliens on board and those on Ellis Island are regarded as "stopped at the border." n19 In the final paragraph, the Court rejected the proposition that "respondent's continued exclusion deprives him of any statutory or constitutional right." \b0 \i \ul0 Mezei,\b0 \i0 \ul0  345 U.S. at 215. It is not certain whether the Court viewed constitutional protections as inapplicable to post-exclusion confinement, or applicable but not infringed.  In any event, it is clear that the Court's rationale and holding did not go beyond the case of an alien already "barred from entry on security grounds." Both the fact that the exclusion determination already had been made and the involvement of national security considerations were critical.  The Court observed that to admit an alien \b0 \i \ul0 already\b0 \i0 \ul0  denied the privilege of entry, particularly where \b \i0 \ul0 [*23]\b0 \i0 \ul0   the admission would be permanent in fact, if not in name, "nullifies the very purpose of the exclusion proceeding." \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 216. Furthermore, in "[a]n exclusion proceeding grounded on . . . national security . . . neither the rationale nor the statutory authority for such release exists. . . ." \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  The Court declined to substitute its judgment for the congressional determination that aliens ordered excluded should not be permitted even a temporary entry. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n19 Amici's position is consistent with the Court's observation.  They do not assert that petitioners effected an "entry" or otherwise acquired constitutional protection upon debarkation.  Rather, they assert constitutional rights that apply without regard to entry.  \b0 \i \ul0 Mezei,\b0 \i0 \ul0  by contrast, involved two sets of rights for which entry has been held to be a prerequisite: procedural due process with respect to admission, and certain statutory release procedures.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 None of the critical circumstances in \b0 \i \ul0 Mezei\b0 \i0 \ul0  is present here.  Petitioners challenge government practices in the incarceration of excludable, not excluded, aliens.  Their temporary parole would not defeat the purpose of the proceeding, which is \b \i0 \ul0 [*24]\b0 \i0 \ul0   to determine the merits of their applications for political asylum.  n20 The government does not contend that petitioners pose a security risk nor that they were incarcerated on that basis. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n20 Nor would temporary parole thwart the political branches' plenary control over admission.  In contrast to the situation in \b0 \i \ul0 Mezei,\b0 \i0 \ul0  deportation will still be possible since Haiti is willing to receive petitioners.  \b0 \i \ul0 Jean,\b0 \i0 \ul0  727 F.2d at 974 n.26 (App. A-18).
\par \fs20 \b0 \i \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Mezei\b0 \i0 \ul0  did not allude to, much less purport to decide, the issue central to this case: whether invidious race discrimination in the incarceration of excludable aliens is immune from constitutional scrutiny.  The Court's treatment of \b0 \i \ul0 Mezei'\b0 \i0 \ul0 s procedural rights does not suggest that the equal protection principle would not apply to the substantive decision to incarcerate.  n21 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n21 Because an alien who has entered the country is likely to have greater ties to the community, his stake in being permitted to remain is greater, and he is arguably entitled to greater procedural protection.  No such rationale would support a difference in treatment of admitted and unadmitted aliens with respect to racial discrimination.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  \b \i0 \ul0 [*25]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Thus, contrary to the Eleventh Circuit's conclusion, \b0 \i \ul0 Mezei\b0 \i0 \ul0  does not "compel" the conclusion that excludable aliens lack constitutional protection with respect to incarceration pending an exclusion decision.  Until the decision below, no court had interpreted \b0 \i \ul0 Mezei\b0 \i0 \ul0  as holding the Constitution inapplicable to the incarceration of excludable aliens.  Indeed, the lower court's broad view that this Court has ruled out the applicability of constitutional protections to excludable aliens in all circumstances related to admission conflicts with decisions of the Second Circuit, \b0 \i \ul0 Augustin v. Sava,\b0 \i0 \ul0  No. 83-2326, slip op. at 3877-78 (2d Cir. May 22, 1984); n22 \b0 \i \ul0 Yiu Sing Chun v. Sava,\b0 \i0 \ul0  708 F.2d 869, 877 (2d Cir. 1983), and the Tenth Circuit, \b0 \i \ul0 Rodriguez-Fernandez v. Wilkinson,\b0 \i0 \ul0  654 F.2d at 1388. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n22 In \b0 \i \ul0 Augustin,\b0 \i0 \ul0  the Second Circuit indicated that "it appears likely that some due process protection surrounds the determination of whether an alien has sufficiently shown that return to a particular country will jeopardize his life or freedom. . . ." \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 B.  No "Relationship" to the Exclusion Process Places the Incarceration of Petitioners on the \b \i0 \ul0 [*26]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Basis of Their Race Beyond Constitutional Review.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Eleventh Circuit rationalized the result on the theory that the "relationship" between the exclusion decision and incarceration pending an exclusion hearing supported expansion of the entry doctrine.  According to the court, the "key issue" was whether incarceration was "integral" to the exclusion process.  \b0 \i \ul0 Jean,\b0 \i0 \ul0  727 F.2d at 971 (App. A-15).  It answered this question affirmatively, on the ground that one end served by incarceration is to prevent the exclusion process from being preempted by the applicant absconding.  This theory suffers from at least three fatal flaws.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 First, even assuming \b0 \i \ul0 arguendo\b0 \i0 \ul0  that some "relationship" to exclusion might be so strong as to justify an expansion of the entry doctrine, the result below is untenable because the court focused on the wrong relationship.  The court examined the relationship between the exclusion process and incarceration in general or incarceration based on a risk of absconding.  However, the INS did not base its actions here on any perceived risk of absconding, n23 and petitioners do not challenge the general authority of the INS to detain refugees pending \b \i0 \ul0 [*27]\b0 \i0 \ul0   hearings.  Petitioners' sole challenge is to incarceration based on invidious race and national origin discrimination.  To establish that INS incarceration practices are beyond constitutional scrutiny by virtue of a "relationship" with the exclusion decision, it must be shown that \b0 \i \ul0 the use of race\b0 \i0 \ul0  as an incarceration criterion advances that process.  This showing has not been made, and would in any event be impossible.  n24 Since there is \b0 \i \ul0 no\b0 \i0 \ul0  plausible basis, it is unnecessary to consider the degree of relationship that might justify expansion of the entry doctrine. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n23 T. at 1160, 2035, 2338, 2396, 2398.
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n24 There is no basis for thinking that race evidences a propensity to abscond or a threat to security, or implicates any other conceivable legitimate concern.  Thus, the constitutional prohibition of invidious discrimination does not inhibit any legitimate function of detention.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Second, even if the court below had focused on the relationship between the challenged practice -- discriminatory incarceration -- and the exclusion process, there is no support for the theory that a mere "relationship" to an area of legislative or executive discretion eviscerates constitutional \b \i0 \ul0 [*28]\b0 \i0 \ul0   protections.  Indeed, this Court's decisions are to the contrary.  For example, the war power, like authority over immigration, is confided to the Congress and the Executive, who enjoy a "wide scope for the exercise of judgment and discretion" in exercising it.  \b0 \i \ul0 Hirabayashi v. United States,\b0 \i0 \ul0  320 U.S. 81, 93 (1943). \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  L. Tribe, \b0 \i \ul0 American Constitutional Law\b0 \i0 \ul0  \'a7 5-16 at 275 (comparing the war and immigration powers).  Nevertheless, this Court has not hesitated to subject actions having a clear relationship to the war power to constitutional scrutiny, particularly when those actions involve racial or national origin classifications.  \b0 \i \ul0 Korematsu,\b0 \i0 \ul0  323 U.S. 214, involved the quarantine of people of Japanese ancestry during World War II.  Nowithstanding the uncontested fact that the challenged actions were all taken pursuant to the war power, the Court subjected them to "rigid" scrutiny.  Thus, notwithstanding broad congressional authority, "war powers" cannot be used as a "talismanic incantation to support any exercise of congressional power which can be brought within its ambit." \b0 \i \ul0 United States v. Robel,\b0 \i0 \ul0  389 U.S. 258, 263 (1967). Nor \b \i0 \ul0 [*29]\b0 \i0 \ul0   does the incantation of "exclusion power" or "excludable alien" dictate that the incarceration of petitioners can be ordered with the same lack of constitutional safeguards as the exclusion decision.  n25 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n25 \b0 \i \ul0 Landon,\b0 \i0 \ul0  459 U.S. 21, also indicates that the mere involvement of exclusion does not automatically mean that legal standards governing initial admission apply.  That case involved an alien who returned to the United States after a short absence.  Although the Court explicitly recognized that the issue was entry, rather than deportation of a person already present in the country, it held that the alien's ties to the community justified the "assimilation" of her status to that of a resident for the purpose of due process protection.  The Court thus rejected a wooden approach according to which the mere involvement of exclusion immediately precludes any constitutional protections.  Rather the Court looks to the particular facts involved to determine whether the purposes of the entry doctrine would be served.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The third fatal flaw in the Eleventh Circuit's theory is that it proves far too much.  No constitutional right would be applicable to any INS practice \b \i0 \ul0 [*30]\b0 \i0 \ul0   related to the exclusion function.  Immigration practices equally or yet more outrageous than incarceration on the basis of race would be free from constitutional scrutiny.  Boats of refugees could be sunk; border guards could shoot people attempting to cross the border without authorization; vessels owned by nonresident aliens could be confiscated without just compensation, on the mere suspicion that they would be used for illegal immigration -- all immune from constitutional scrutiny.  It strains the imagination to suppose that, if such practices arose, a court could deem them not to be deprivations of life, liberty, or property calling for constitutional review.  As Justice Jackson has pointed out, such cannot be the meaning of this Court's decisions.  n26 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n26 Justice Jackson noted that due process would be violated if an excludable alien were thrown into the sea, set adrift, or deprived of his valuables.  \b0 \i \ul0 Mezei,\b0 \i0 \ul0  345 U.S. at 226-27 (dissenting opinion).

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 CONCLUSION
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This case presents a profound and tragic irony.  Petitioners came to this country risking life itself to seek safe harbor from oppression.  Having come in a quest for freedom, they were incarcerated \b \i0 \ul0 [*31]\b0 \i0 \ul0   in prisons and detention camps because of their race and national origin.  The holding that the federal government can deprive these people of the most basic freedom -- physical liberty -- by application of the criterion most condemned by our history and values -- invidious racial discrimination -- without the slightest degree of constitutional scrutiny, is too unprecedented, its rationale too at odds with our basic values, and its consequences too great, to escape review by this Court.
