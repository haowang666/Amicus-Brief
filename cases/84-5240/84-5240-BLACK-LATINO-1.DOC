\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Whether intentional and invidious discrimination by federal officials, in incarcerating black Haitian refugees in prisons and detention camps on the basis of their race and national origin, is wholly immune from constitutional scrutiny under the equal protection guarantee of the Fifth Amendment.

(NAACP); the National Conference of Black Lawyers (NCBL); the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC); the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF); the following Members of Congress, who are members of the Haitian Refugee Task Force of the Congressional Black Caucus -- Rep.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The NAACP is a non-profit corporation serving approximately 500,000 members nationwide, whose objectives include the achievement of equal rights and the elimination by racial discrimination.  The NCBL is a non-profit national membership organization comprised of black attorneys, among whose goals is the elimination of invidious discrimination from law and public policy.  SCLC is a non-profit membership organization dedicated to the achievement and protection of civil rights for all minorities.  MALDEF is a national hispanic civil rights organization whose principal objective is to protect the rights of hispanics, both documented and undocumented, through litigation and advocacy.  The NAACP, NCBL, SCLC, and MALDEF are interested in this case because of the effects of invidious discrimination on black Haitians, and because the decision below also threatens minority citizens and aliens by eroding the principle that the Constitution universally condemns invidious race and national origin discrimination.

As Members of Congress, these \b0 \i \ul0 amici\b0 \i0 \ul0  have a compelling interest in the availability of judicial review to ensure that executive agencies implement legislation, including the immigration laws, consistently with the Constitution.  Their interest is particularly compelling where, as in this case, federal personnel contravened legislative policy condemning the use of racial criteria in the immigration context.  n1

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This Court granted certiorari to review the unprecedented holding of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in \b0 \i \ul0 Jean v. Nelson,\b0 \i0 \ul0  727 F.2d 957 (11th Cir. 1984) (\b0 \i \ul0 en banc\b0 \i0 \ul0 ), n2 that invidious discrimination by Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) functionaries in the incarceration of Haitian refugees is wholly beyond constitutional scrutiny.

\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n2 Appendix to Petition for Writ of Certiorari (P.A.) A1.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Petitioners are black Haitian refugees who have come to the United States since May 20, 1981 to seek political asylum, often at great risk to their lives.  Upon their arrival, INS personnel intentionally discriminated against them on the basis of their race and nationality in singling them out from other admission applicants for prolonged incarceration in remote federal prisons and detention camps.  \b0 \i \ul0 Jean v. Nelson,\b0 \i0 \ul0  711 F.2d 1455, 1501 (11th Cir. 1983) (P.A. A35), \b0 \i \ul0 reheard en banc,\b0 \i0 \ul0  727 F.2d 957 (11th Cir. 1984) (P.A. A1).  n3 The evidence of intentional discrimination in the incarceration of black Haitians was largely unrebutted, except by the government's "mere protestation."  \b \i0 \ul0 [*6]\b0 \i0 \ul0   P.A. A73.  A "plethora" of evidence showed that INS personnel specifically targeted Haitians for detention.  P.A. A70.  Statistical evidence disclosed a stark pattern of race and national origin discrimination.  P.A. A69.  INS functionaries' detention decisions had a "vastly disproportionate impact on Haitians, as opposed to non-Haitian, immigrants." P.A. A67.  Uncontradicted evidence demonstrated that INS agents granted parole n4 (\b0 \i \ul0 i.e.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  release pending an exclusion hearing) or deferred inspection to a far larger percentage of non-Haitians than Haitians.  \b0 \i \ul0 Louis v. Nelson,\b0 \i0 \ul0  544 F. Supp. 973, 982 (S.D. Fla. 1982) (P.A. A93, A102).  For example, data from INS District VI indicated that, whereas 35 percent of non-Haitians seeking entry but not promptly admitted or transferred n5 from August 1 to November 1, 1981 were paroled on the day of arrival, all 1143 Haitians were detained.  Plaintiffs' Exhibit (Ex.) 191 (chart 3); R. v. 53, p. 2951; R. 2986.  Data concerning persons whose admissibility was preliminarily challenged upon arrival at Miami's airport showed that over 96 percent of non-Haitians were paroled or granted deferred inspection, compared with only two-thirds \b \i0 \ul0 [*7]\b0 \i0 \ul0   of the Haitians.  Ex. 187 (chart 2); R. v. 53, pp. 2876, 2920.  Expert statistical testimony described the likelihood of such disparity occurring by chance as "far less than one in ten billion," and "a statistical joke." P.A. A68; R. v. 53, pp. 2949-50.  Yet the government failed to explain what factors parole decisions were based on, and in fact petitioners presented neither a national security threat nor a risk of absconding.  n6 P.A. A77; \b0 \i \ul0 Louis v. Nelson,\b0 \i0 \ul0  544 F. Supp. 1004, 1006 (S.D. Fla. 1982) (P.A. A125, A127).

\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n3 Upon rehearing \b0 \i \ul0 en banc,\b0 \i0 \ul0  the court adopted the facts as stated in the trial court and panel opinions.  P.A. A6.  Implicitly concurring in the panel opinion's premise that the evidence establishes intentional discrimination, the court proceeded to decide "[t]he central question raised by this case in its present posture": "whether the Haitian plaintiffs may invoke the equal protection guarantee" with respect to the denial of release from detention.  \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  The court answered that question in the negative, and remanded for findings on the narrower factual issue of the existence of a "facially legitimate and bona fide reason" for parole denial.  P.A. A22.  Accordingly, the validity of the constitutional ruling must be assessed on the premise of invidious INS discrimination.
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n4 The Attorney General has authority to release ("parole") aliens pending exclusion hearings under 8 U.S.C. \'a7 1182(d)(5) (1982).

\par \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n6 Since 1954, the Attorney General applied a uniform policy of granting parole to all who sought it, except where there was a demonstrable threat to national security or risk of absconding.  That policy avoided "needless confinement" and "reflect[ed] the human qualities of an enlightened civilization." \b0 \i \ul0 Leny May Ma v. Barber,\b0 \i0 \ul0  357 U.S. 185, 190 (1958). However, the policy was abandoned in 1982.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Unrebutted evidence also established invidious discrimination in the treatment of Haitians after initial detention.  Haitians generally were detained for unusually prolonged periods, sometimes for more than a year.  P.A. A43.  Unlike almost all aliens of any other nationality or race, Haitians were separated from other family members.  P.A. A101-02 n.24.  Many father and mothers were separated from their minor children through transfers or by being retained in custody after release of their children.  \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  Also unlike aliens of other nationalities or races, petitioners were shipped to remote detention centers in what the district court described as a "human shell game." \b0 \i \ul0 Louis v. Meissner,\b0 \i0 \ul0  530 F. Supp. 924, 926 (S.D. Fla. 1981) (P.A. A144, A146).  The camps were located in "desolate, remote, hostile, culturally diverse areas, containing a paucity of available legal support and few, if any Creole interpreters." \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  At many camps, medical facilities were inadequate and immigration counsel were unavailable.  n7 Petitioners were confined to substandard facilities or otherwise subjected to conditions considerably harsher than those faced by most non-Haitian detainees.  \b \i0 \ul0 [*9]\b0 \i0 \ul0   n8 Some were physically abused or deprived of necessary medical care.  n9

R. v. 44, p. 1385.  In contrast, Cuban refugees were taken inside to wait and were given numbers.  \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  Unlike any other aliens, Haitians were subjected to mass exclusion hearings without adequate translation.  These hearings were held in locked courtrooms from which \b0 \i \ul0 pro bono\b0 \i0 \ul0  counsel were barred.  n11 In other instances, the INS prevented counsel from representing their clients by scheduling simultaneous appearances in multiple courtrooms.  INS officials also departed from normal procedures by serving Haitians with hearing notices before they could present asylum claims to the INS district director.  P.A. A72.  This procedure effectively prevented Haitians from seeking asylum administratively.  \b \i0 \ul0 [*10]\b0 \i0 \ul0   n12

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The discriminatory treatment by INS functionaries occurred in the context of a clear historical pattern of discrimination against other Haitian refugees, which includes the discriminatory denial of parole.  n13 Haitian refugees also have been improperly denied their statutory right to a hearing before an immigration judge on their claims for political asylum.  n14 They have been denied the right to work during the pendency of such claims.  n15 Information supporting such claims has been withheld.  n16 Even the fundamental right to full, fair, and nondiscriminatory consideration of asylum claims has been denied.  n17

\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 No principle is more fundamental to our nation's values than that the Constitution condemns invidious governmental discrimination.  The holding that the government could incarcerate a person on the basis of his race or national origin free from any constitutional scrutiny, is without precedent since the Dred Scott decision.  If the decision is allowed to stand, petitioners and persons of other disfavored races or nationalities seeking admission to this country could be held in prolonged confinement that would constitute a gross violation of constitutional rights if inflicted on citizens, or even on aliens who had entered the country \b \i0 \ul0 [*13]\b0 \i0 \ul0   illegally.  Accordingly, the holding below not only has a devastating effect on black Haitian refugees, but grave implications for all aliens seeking admission and for the integrity of the equal protection principle at issue.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This Court has clearly established that excludable aliens are persons within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.  Accordingly, aliens are guaranteed equal protection.  The Fifth Amendment applies whether the person deprived of liberty is inside the country, outside it, or "at the border," as petitioners are deemed to be.  In particular, constitutional protections apply to actions taken pursuant to the Attorney General's authority to parole excludable aliens.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Eleventh Circuit's theory that the entry doctrine immunizes discriminatory incarceration from review is without precedent or merit.  The entry doctrine holds that aliens not previously admitted to the country have no constitutional rights with respect to their admission.  It has never been applied to incarceration, and its rationale is inapplicable in that context.  In this case, petitioners assert no rights with respect to admission or admission procedures.  They claim only the right to be free from \b \i0 \ul0 [*14]\b0 \i0 \ul0   discriminatory incarceration.  Recognition of that right will not affect their rights with respect to admission, nor the authorities' ability to regulate admission.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The lower court's theory that the preadmission incarceration decision is an "integral part" of the exclusion process, and that this places discriminatory incarceration beyond the Constitution's reach, suffers from at least four fatal flaws.  First, the fact that the general authority to incarcerate can serve some of the same policies as exclusion is irrelevant, since petitioners do not challenge incarceration in general, but only the use of race and nationality criteria.  Decisions of this and other courts demonstrate that an "integral" relation to admission of the kind relied on below does not obliterate constitutional protections.  Second, this Court's decisions demonstrate that even an integral, functional relationship between the specific conduct challenged as unconstitutional and an objective established pursuant to plenary congressional and executive authority would not remove the conduct from constitutional scrutiny.  Third, since discriminatory preadmission incarceration not only furthers no admissions policy \b \i0 \ul0 [*15]\b0 \i0 \ul0   or procedure, but is directly contrary to express statutory and executive mandates, there is in fact no cognizable relationship whatsoever, much less an "integral" one.  Finally, it follows from the ruling below that \b0 \i \ul0 no\b0 \i0 \ul0  practice relating to exclusion, including the sinking of boatloads of refugees, would be subject to constitutional review.  That cannot be the meaning of the Constitution or this Court's cases.  Accordingly, the decision below cannot stand.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 I.  THE RULING THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S DEPRIVATION OF A PERSON'S PHYSICAL LIBERTY ON THE BASIS OF HIS RACE OF NATIONAL ORIGIN IS IMMUNE FROM CONSTITUTIONAL SCRUTINY IS WITHOUT PRECEDENT SINCE THE ADOPTION OF THE EQUAL PROTECTION GUARANTEE.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 There is no more firmly established principle than the Constitution's condemnation of invidious governmental race and national origin discrimination.  n19 That principle is embodied in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which prohibits the federal government from denying any person the equal protection of the laws.  Under this provision, cassifications based on race or national origin are constitutionally suspect, and "[a]ll legal restrictions which curtail the \b \i0 \ul0 [*16]\b0 \i0 \ul0   civil rights of a single racial group [are subject] to the most rigid scrutiny. . ." \b0 \i \ul0 Korematsu v.

The significance of the \b \i0 \ul0 [*18]\b0 \i0 \ul0   holding will be still greater if prejudice reappears in official policy.  The prospect is not fanciful; until 1965, Congress and the Executive maintained an official system of discriminatory national origin quotas.

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In addition to the trial court and court of appeals below, two federal courts have addressed the issue now presented.  Both held that involuntary detention of excludable aliens resulting from the exercise of the government's discretionary parole authority prior to a determination on admission is subject to the strictures \b \i0 \ul0 [*29]\b0 \i0 \ul0   of the Fifth Amendment.  \b0 \i \ul0 Nguyen Da Yen v.

The INS invoked the Attorney General's discretionary parole authority under 8 U.S.C. \'a7 1182(d) (5) to permit the children to live in this country.  As a result of that parole decision, certain children who were not properly adopted were allegedly involuntarily detained in the custody of adoptive parents.  Accordingly, their status was identical in all relevant respects to that of petitioners in this case: excludable aliens physically present in the United States but not "admitted," who were involuntarily detained as a result of a parole decision under 8 U.S.C. \'a7 1182(d) (5).  n30 As in this case, the government argued that its actions under the parole statute are not subject to constitutional review.  The Ninth Circuit emphatically \b \i0 \ul0 [*30]\b0 \i0 \ul0   rejoined that the challenged action was necessarily subject to constitutional scrutiny notwithstanding any intent to immunize it from review:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Simply put, defendants' discretion does not extend to the violation of constitutional rights, nor can it -- the sovereignty they exercise, whether elegated by Congress to be exercised with strict limitations or in a broadly discretionary manner, is always and necessarily bounded by the limitations placed on that power in the Constitution.

\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n30 In \b0 \i \ul0 Nguyen Da Yen\b0 \i0 \ul0  involuntary detention resulted from decisions to grant parole, rather than decisions to deny it, as in this case.  However, this factual distinction has no bearing on the legal issue presented.  There is no plausible basis for holding that an affirmative parole decision indirectly resulting in incarceration is subject to review, but a decision to confine a person in federal prison is not.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In sum, the precedents of \b \i0 \ul0 [*31]\b0 \i0 \ul0   this and other courts demonstrate that the federal government may not deprive a person of his physical liberty pending an exclusion hearing except upon affording the equal protection of the law.  Even if one treats petitioners as if they were outside the United States, or "stopped at the border," there simply is no valid basis for concluding that their incarceration is exempt from constitutional scrutiny.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 III.  THE ENTRY DOCTRINE DOES NOT IMMUNIZE PRE-HEARING INCARCERATION FROM CONSTITUTIONAL SCRUTINY.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 A.  The Entry Doctrine Applies Only to the Decision to Admit or Exclude an Alien and the Procedures Used to Reach that Determination.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Eleventh Circuit rested its unprecedented decision on a fundamental misconception of the "entry doctrine." That doctrine provides that aliens who have not "entered" the United States have no constitutional protection with respect to their admission.  \b0 \i \ul0 See, e.g., \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Nishimura Ekiu v. United States,\b0 \i0 \ul0  142 U.S. 651 (1892). It has never been applied to invidious discrimination in incarceration, and its rationale has no relevance to incarceration.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The doctrine derives from legal principles specifically related to the admission of aliens.  \b \i0 \ul0 [*32]\b0 \i0 \ul0   This Court has held the power to regulate immigration to be an essential attribute of sovereignty.  \b0 \i \ul0 The Chinese Exclusion Case,\b0 \i0 \ul0  130 U.S. 581, 609 (1889). Consequently, the political branches have been allowed broad authority to define grounds of eligibility for entry or status as an immigrant or non-immigrant, and to establish procedures by which those criteria will be applied.  \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  Once an alien has entered the country, however, he may not be expelled or denied readmission without the benefit of certain constitutional protections.  \b0 \i \ul0 See, e.g., \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Kwong Hai Chew v. Colding,\b0 \i0 \ul0  344 U.S. 590, 600 (1953); \b0 \i \ul0 Wong Yang Sung v. McGrath,\b0 \i0 \ul0  339 U.S. 33, 49-50, \b0 \i \ul0 aff'd as mod'd,\b0 \i0 \ul0  339 U.S. 908 (1950); \b0 \i \ul0 The Japanese Immigrant Case,\b0 \i0 \ul0  189 U.S. 86 (1903).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Consistent with the entry doctrine's purpose, this Court has applied it only to disputes over admissibility or the procedures used to determine admissibility.  The seminal entry fiction case, \b0 \i \ul0 Nishimura Ekiu v. United States,\b0 \i0 \ul0  142 U.S. 651 (1892), addressed the process due to an excludable alien who was allowed to disembark and remain in the country pending \b \i0 \ul0 [*33]\b0 \i0 \ul0   a determination of her admissibility.  The Court held that unadmitted aliens are due only that process with respect to their admission applications that is granted by Congress and Executive officials acting within the scope of their delegated powers.  \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 660. The political branches' authority over admission would be compromised if an alien gained greater rights with respect to admission merely by being permitted to disembark pending a ruling on her application; hence the fiction that an alien paroled upon arrival is deemed not to have "entered" the country for purposes of admission.  Nothing in the Court's opinion suggests that plenary congressional authority with respect to admission standards and procedures has any bearing on constitutional rights applicable to aliens in any other context, including incarceration.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The distinction between the rights of admitted and unadmitted aliens was clarified in \b0 \i \ul0 Kwong Hai Chew v. Colding,\b0 \i0 \ul0  344 U.S. 590 (1953). The Court held that a resident alien seeking to re-enter the country after a temporary absence has constitutional rights with respect to his admission, unlike an alien who has not previously entered.  \b \i0 \ul0 [*34]\b0 \i0 \ul0   The resident alien's exclusion without notice of the charges against him therefore violated the Fifth Amendment.  The Court also indicated that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment would not protect an excludable alien in exclusion proceedings, but did not address rights in any other contexts.  n31 \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 600. 
\par \pard

It is clear from the context, however, that the court was addressing the protections applicable to an exclusion proceeding, and did not purport to suggest, much less hold, that protections are lacking in other situations.  Indeed, such a suggestion would have been flatly inconsistent with numerous holdings recognizing that aliens are protected by the Constitution.  \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  Section II, pp. 12-18 \b0 \i \ul0 supra.\b0 \i0 \ul0

For the same reason, parole pending deportation would have resulted in a \b0 \i \ul0 de facto\b0 \i0 \ul0  indefinite admission, thereby nullifying the exclusion decision.  The Court indicated that \b0 \i \ul0 Mezei's de facto\b0 \i0 \ul0  confinement did not violate his constitutional rights, resting its judgment on the plenary power to exclude.  \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 215.  Because \b0 \i \ul0 Mezei\b0 \i0 \ul0  did not involve invidious race or nationality discrimination, and because the parole of petitioners pending their exclusion hearings would not impinge upon -- much less nullify -- the authority to exclude them, \b0 \i \ul0 Mezei\b0 \i0 \ul0  does not support the result below.

Plasencia,\b0 \i0 \ul0  459 U.S. 21, 32 (1982), the Court stated again that "an [excludable] alien seeking \b0 \i \ul0 initial\b0 \i0 \ul0  admission to the United States . . . has no constitutional rights \b0 \i \ul0 regarding his application\b0 \i0 \ul0  [for admission]." \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  (emphasis added).

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The present case does not involve admission, but the right not to be deprived of physical liberty on grounds of race or national origin.  Petitioners do not assert in this Court a right to admission, nor any procedural rights with respect to the admission decision.  Parole will have no effect on their rights with respect to admission.  \b0 \i \ul0 E.g., \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Leng May Ma v. Barber,\b0 \i0 \ul0  357 U.S. 185 (1958); \b0 \i \ul0 Kaplan v. Tod,\b0 \i0 \ul0  267 U.S. 228 (1925). Temporary release of certain Haitians has not hampered the INS in subsequently deporting them.  Thus, petitioners' challenge \b \i0 \ul0 [*38]\b0 \i0 \ul0   to race and nationality discrimination in incarceration does not, even indirectly, put in question the political branches' plenary authority over admission.  Accordingly, the function of the entry doctrine is not implicated.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 B.  No Relationship to the Admission Process Places the Incarceration of Petitioners on the Basis of Their Race or Nationality Beyond Constitutional Review.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The court below correctly recognized that incarceration, not admission, was at stake.  P.A. A6.  However, it stated that "the key question" was whether the parole decision is "an integral part" of the admissions process.  \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 971.  The court answered the question affirmatively, despite the fact that pre-hearing detention is by no means essential to exclusion, and was exceptional rather than routine until after the filing of this litigation.  \b0 \i \ul0 Amici\b0 \i0 \ul0  submit that a decision that has no bearing on admission or admission policies cannot be deemed immune from review under the entry doctrine merely because it is taken by immigration agents prior to an alien's admission.  n36 The Eleventh Circuit apparently agrees, since it attempted to justify its conclusion by alluding to policies that both admission \b \i0 \ul0 [*39]\b0 \i0 \ul0   policy and preadmission detention allegedly foster, concluding that "the immediate implications of parole and legal admission are identical in a number of important respects." P.A. A16.  The court below offered no authority for its novel theory that an alleged "integral" relationship between an area of executive and congressional discretion (admission of aliens) and another type of government action (incarceration) renders the latter immune from constitutional scrutiny.  Indeed, no such precedent exists.  This is not surprising, for the Eleventh Circuit's theory suffers from at least four fatal flaws. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n36 Otherwise, for example, Congress would be free to authorize INS employees to resolve summarily any criminal charges brought against an excludable alien, thereby making that decision "an integral part" of the admissions process and nullifying all constitutional safeguards.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 First, even assuming that an integral, functional relationship to an area of absolute executive discretion might justify also immunizing incarceration from constitutional review, the Eleventh Circuit erred by examining the wrong relationship.  The Court examined the nexus between exclusion and preadmission \b \i0 \ul0 [*40]\b0 \i0 \ul0   incarceration in general.  That relationship is irrelevant because petitioners do not here challenge the constitutionality of a grant of general authority to the Attorney General to detain refugees pending exclusion hearings.  Nor do they challenge detention decisions reached solely on the basis of the legitimate policies alluded to by the court.  n37 Rather, petitioners challenge incarceration based on invidious race and national origin discrimination.  Accordingly, if the government seeks to escape the constitutional strictures applicable to incarceration, it must first identify an integral relationship between the discretionary authority to admit and incarceration on the basis of race or national origin.  That argument would have to identify a substantive admissions policy or procedure that is furthered by those detention criteria.  No such demonstration has been attempted, and none would be possible. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n37 The court below cited national security and quoted language from \b0 \i \ul0 Mezei\b0 \i0 \ul0  referring to the prevention of absconding pending deportation.  P.A. A15-16.  However, there was no evidence that petitioners posed either a national security threat or risk of absconding, and the INS did not claim to have based its detention decisions on such findings.  See p. 4 \b0 \i \ul0 supra.\b0 \i0 \ul0  While the court below also cited the protection of employment, P.A. A16, the use of incarceration to protect jobs is superfluous in light of the ability to condition parole on non-employment.  8 U.S.C. \'a7 1182(d) (5).
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  \b \i0 \ul0 [*41]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This Court's decisions conclusively demonstrate that the relationship upon which the Eleventh Circuit relied -- between exclusion and the general practice of incarceration pending admission -- cannot immunize other specific challenged conduct from constitutional review.  In \b0 \i \ul0 Wong Wing,\b0 \i0 \ul0  163 U.S. 228, this Court reviewed an Act of Congress authorizing the imprisonment of aliens who failed to follow admission procedures upon arrival.  Wong Wing challenged the statute on the ground that the imposition of such imprisonment without indictment or trial by jury violated consitutional guarantees.  The general government program in \b0 \i \ul0 Wong Wing\b0 \i0 \ul0  -- punishment of those who evade the admissions process -- is as integral to exclusion as pre-hearing incarceration.  n38 Therefore, the factual postures of \b0 \i \ul0 Wong Wing\b0 \i0 \ul0  and this case are essentially identical.  In each case, the general government authority pursuant to which the aliens were incarcerated promotes admissions policy, and in that sense is "integral" to it.  Nevertheless, in \b0 \i \ul0 Wong Wing,\b0 \i0 \ul0  the Court subjected the statute to constitutional scrutiny, and struck it down. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n38 Punishment of evasion advances admission policy by deterring aliens who may not be eligible for admission from illegally entering the United States without screening.  It thus helps to ensure that the INS will have an opportunity to apply the admissions standards defined by Congress and the Executive.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  \b \i0 \ul0 [*42]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360  \b0 \i \ul0 United States v. Henry,\b0 \i0 \ul0  604 F.2d 908, also illustrates the invalidity of the integral relationship theory.  Upon arrival in this country, Henry was questioned by INS authorities and lied about his citizenship.  When prosecuted for misrepresenting his citizenship, he defended on the ground that \b0 \i \ul0 Miranda\b0 \i0 \ul0  warnings had not been given.  As in this case, the INS argued that Henry lacked constitutional protection bacause the questioning was an integral part of the exercise of the Executive's authority to exclude aliens.  Indeed, inspection upon entry is far more integral to the admission decision than prolonged detention; unlike incarceration, inspection in \b0 \i \ul0 essential\b0 \i0 \ul0  to admission.  Yet the Fifth Circuit held that the Fifth Amendment applied and was violated.  \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 914, 920.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In sum, the fact that the general authority to detain aliens pending exclusion hearings is functionally related to some aspects of an admission procedure cannot immunize from judicial review invidious discrimination in the application of that authority.  To hold otherwise would be directly contrary to \b0 \i \ul0 Wong Wing\b0 \i0 \ul0  and \b0 \i \ul0 Henry,\b0 \i0 \ul0  as well as cases such as \b0 \i \ul0 Nguyen Da Yen.\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b \i0 \ul0 [*43]\b0 \i0 \ul0   n39

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The second fatal flaw in the Eleventh Circuit theory is that, even where the constitutionally challenged practice directly advances executive or legislative policy in an area committed to the political branches' authority, that integral relationship does not immunize the challenged conduct from review.  The Court has clearly established this principle in cases involving the war power.  Like the authority over immigration, the war power is committed to Congress and the Executive, who enjoy a "wide scope for the exercise of judgment and discretion" in exercising it.  \b0 \i \ul0 Hirabayashi v. United States,\b0 \i0 \ul0  320 U.S. 81, 93 (1943). \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  L. Tribe, \b0 \i \ul0 American Constitutional Law\b0 \i0 \ul0  \'a7 5-16 at 276 (comparing the war and immigration powers).  Nevertheless, this Court has subjected actions taken pursuant to the war power to vigorous constitutional scrutiny.  For example, \b0 \i \ul0 Korematsu,\b0 \i0 \ul0  323 U.S. 214, involved the wartime decision by military authorities to exclude persons of Japanese ancestry from a large area of the western United States, and to quarantine them in relocation camps.  The authorities deemed this necessary because \b \i0 \ul0 [*44]\b0 \i0 \ul0   they believed that the loyalties of some Japanese Americans, who could not be readily identified and segregated from others, would lie with Japan.  Japanese loyalists might prove a grave threat to security at home and the war effort abroad by sabotaging military facilities or providing intelligence to the enemy.  Although the specific challenged practice -- use of racial and national origin criteria in incarceration -- allegedly was integral to the war effort, and was taken pursuant to the congressional and executive war power, this Court subjected that action to constitutional scrutiny.  Indeed, as is appropriate in the case of discrimination on the basis of suspect classifications, the level of scrutiny was "the most rigid." \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 216. While the Court found the relationship between the challenged practice and the war effort to be pertinent to the \b0 \i \ul0 application\b0 \i0 \ul0  of the constitutional standard, it had no bearing whatsoever on the \b0 \i \ul0 applicability\b0 \i0 \ul0  of constitutional limits.  Similarly, in \b0 \i \ul0 Hirabayashi,\b0 \i0 \ul0  this Court held that a wartime curfew applicable to persons of Japanese descent was subject to strict constitutional scrutiny.  320 U.S. at 93-105. \b \i0 \ul0 [*45]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 More recently, in \b0 \i \ul0 United States v. Robel,\b0 \i0 \ul0  389 U.S. 258 (1967), Congress' effort to prohibit communists from working at defense facilities received close constitutional scrutiny, notwithstanding the obvious relationship of the practice to the war power.  This Court also has subjected the male-only draft registration program to equal protection scrutiny, although it is an integral part of Congress' program to raise and regulate armies.  \b0 \i \ul0 Rostker v. Goldberg,\b0 \i0 \ul0  453 U.S. 57 (1981). n40 In sum, this Court's decisions consistently have demonstrated that the mere relationship of a challenged practice -- particularly one involving the deprivation of physical liberty -- to an area of special legislative and executive discretion does not immunize that action from constitutional scrutiny.  This Court's declaration in \b0 \i \ul0 Robel\b0 \i0 \ul0  concerning the was power is equally applicable to the immigration power; invocation of that authority cannot serve as a "talismatic incantation to support any exercise of congressional power which can be brought within its ambit." 389 U.S. at 263.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The third fatal flaw in the analysis below is that, if the court had focused on the challenged practices, it would have found \b0 \i \ul0 no\b0 \i0 \ul0  pertinent relationship, much less an "integral" one, since discriminatory incarceration advances no admission policy.  In the first place, the use of race and national origin criteria in the immigration context is directly contrary to both express congressional and executive policy.  n41 Secondly, even in the absence of such a direct conflict with official policy, there is no reason to believe that persons of particular races or nationalities are \b0 \i \ul0 ipso facto\b0 \i0 \ul0  security threats or likely to abscond.  Therefore, no immigration policy would be advanced by racial or national origin criteria, and no legitimate government interest will be harmed by recognizing petitioners' constitutional rights.

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The fourth fatal flaw in the Eleventh Circuit's theory is that it proves far too much.  No constitutional right would be applicable to any INS practice integrally related to exclusion.  Boats of refugees could be sunk; border guards could shoot people attempting to cross the border without authorization; excluded aliens could \b \i0 \ul0 [*47]\b0 \i0 \ul0   be put to death if no other country agreed to accept them; property owned by nonresident aliens could be confiscated without just compensation -- all beyond constitutional scrutiny.  It is unimaginable that, if such practices arose, a court would not find them to be deprivations of life, liberty, or property requiring constitutional review.  As Justice Jackson and others have pointed out, such cannot be the meaning of this Court's decisions.  n42

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 CONCLUSION
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This case presents a profound and tragic irony.  Petitioners came to this country risking life itself to seek safe harbor from oppression.  Having come in a quest for freedom, they were incarcerated in prisons and detention camps because of their race and national origin.  \b \i0 \ul0 [*48]\b0 \i0 \ul0   the holding that the federal government can deprive these people of the most basic freedom -- physical liberty -- by application of the criterion most condemned by our history and values -- invidious race and national origin discrimination -- without the slightest degree of constitutional scrutiny, is too unprecedented, its rationale too at odds with our basic values, and its consequences too great, to be sanctioned by this Court.
