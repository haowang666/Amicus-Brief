\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The statements in the decision of the court below that imply that the President has both statutory and inherent, extra-constitutional powers over immigration which would permit invidious discrimination in the incarceration of excludable aliens, unchecked by the Constitution, are dangerous and erroneous \b0 \i \ul0 obiter dicta.  As obiter dicta\b0 \i0 \ul0  the proposition played no role in the decision because only actions \b \i0 \ul0 [*4]\b0 \i0 \ul0   of low-level officials were involved and these actions were in direct conflict with the President's publicly proclaimed non-discriminatory policy.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The doctrine that the President has inherent, extra-constitutional power over immigration is at war with our constitutional scheme.  Even assuming that the President has such powers over immigration and that they had been implicated in this case, such powers, as are all Presidential powers, are limited by the Constitution, including the Bill of Rights.  Thus, even if the President had authorized the invidiously discriminatory incarceration of the black Haitian refugees who are petitioners in this case, such actions would have been subject to constitutional scrutiny under the equal protection guarantees of the fifth amendment.  Furthermore, as even the lower court recognized, the President's powers over immigration are limited by congressional power.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 I.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 THE DOCTRINE THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS INHERENT AND STATUTORY POWER OVER IMMIGRATION PERMITING DISCRIMINATORY INCARCERATION OF BLACK HAITIAN REFUGEES UNCHECKED BY \b0 \i \ul0 ANY\b0 \i0 \ul0  CONSTITUTIONAL SCRUTINY IS DANGEROUS \b0 \i \ul0 OBITER DICTA\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Notwithstanding the findings by the Eleventh \b \i0 \ul0 [*5]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Circuit panel that overwhelming and unrebutted evidence demonstrated a stark pattern of invidious discrimination by low-level officials, \b0 \i \ul0 Jean v. Nelson,\b0 \i0 \ul0  711 F.2d 1455, 1483-1502 (11th Cir. 1983), which the \b0 \i \ul0 en banc\b0 \i0 \ul0  court neither questioned nor disturbed, \b0 \i \ul0 Jean v. Nelson,\b0 \i0 \ul0  727 F.2d 957, 962 (11th Cir. 1984) (\b0 \i \ul0 em banc\b0 \i0 \ul0 ), the lower court declined to subject the actions of these low-level officials to \b0 \i \ul0 any\b0 \i0 \ul0  constitutional scrutiny.  \b0 \i \ul0 Id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 978. In reaching this unprecedented decision, the \b0 \i \ul0 en banc\b0 \i0 \ul0  court stated that the President had inherent, extra-constitutional powers over immigration, \b0 \i \ul0 id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 963-967, and statutory powers under the Immigration and Nationality Act ("INA"), \b0 \i \ul0 id.\b0 \i0 \ul0  at 965-67, 978, which were not limited by the Constitution.  The court below declared that
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Executive has two sources of authority in this area: (1) power delegated by Congress through statutes such as the INA and (2) its inherent power, arising out of the Executive's plenary authority over foreign relations.  * \b0 \i \ul0 United States ex rel. Knauff v. Shaughnessy,\b0 \i0 \ul0  338 U.S. 537, 542, 70 S. Ct. 309, 312, 94 L. Ed. 317 (1950). \b \i0 \ul0 [*6]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Theoretically, the President has an independent source of power concerning immigration policy, at least with regard to matters that are not the subject of a statutory mandate or an express prohibition.

\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 * As both the district court and the panel found, this case does \b0 \i \ul0 not\b0 \i0 \ul0  involve foreign affairs.  \b0 \i \ul0 Jean,\b0 \i0 \ul0  711 F.2d at 1478; \b0 \i \ul0 Louis v. Nelson,\b0 \i0 \ul0  544 F. Supp. 973, 996 (S.D. Fla. 1982). In any event, this Court has consistently recognized that even the President's broad powers over the field of foreign affairs must be exercised within the limits of the Constitution.  \b0 \i \ul0 Haig v. Agee,\b0 \i0 \ul0  453 U.S. 280, 289 n.17 (1981).
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This language is \b0 \i \ul0 obiter dicta\b0 \i0 \ul0  and, as demonstrated below, erroneous and dangerous \b0 \i \ul0 dicta.\b0 \i0 \ul0  First, as the panel opinion makes clear, only the actions of low-level officials were at issue.  \b0 \i \ul0 Jean\b0 \i0 \ul0  \b0 \i \ul0 v. Nelson,\b0 \i0 \ul0  711 F.2d at 1470-71. Second, the actions of these low-level immigration officials were in direct conflict with the publicly proclaimed policy of the President and the Attorney General that the new mandatory detention policy should be applied evenhandedly to \b \i0 \ul0 [*7]\b0 \i0 \ul0   all aliens seeking asylum.  In describing this new policy to the Congress, the Attorney Ceneral called for an "evenhanded" rule of detention.  \b0 \i \ul0 Jean,\b0 \i0 \ul0  711 F.id at 1471. The President himself confirmed that administrative action was to be "consistent with fair procedures and our constitution," and "consistent with our values of individual privacy and freedom." Statement of the President, United States Immigration and Refugee Policy, July 30, 1981 at 829.  (The Statement is cited in \b0 \i \ul0 Jean,\b0 \i0 \ul0  711 F.2d at 1470-71). * 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 * Congress also required a non-discriminatory policy.  In 1965 it abolished the national origin quota system and racial restrictions and prohibited discrimination based on race, sex, nationality, place of birth or place of residence in all immigration matters.  Act of October 3, 1965, P.L. 89-236, 79 Stat. 911, 8 U.S.C. \'a7 1152(a) (1982).  Furthermore, in 1968, the United States acceded to the United Nations Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, which prohibits discrimination against refugees on the grounds of race or national origin.  Art. 3.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 ALL PRESIDENTIAL POWER IS LIMITED BY THE CONSTITUTION \b \i0 \ul0 [*8]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The assumption by the court below that the President has statutory and "inherent," extra-constitutional power over immigration not limited by the Constitution is at war with our constitutional system of limited, delegated power.  It is unsupported by history or precedent.  Even if this Court were to hold that such "inherent" powers -- not derived from the Constitution -- over immigration exist, they are limited, as are all Presidential powers, by the Constitution.  ** 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 ** Furthermore, even the lower court conceded that such Presidential immigration powers are limited by statute.  \b0 \i \ul0 Jean,\b0 \i0 \ul0  727 F.2d at 965.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 A.  THE EXECUTIVE DOES NOT HAVE "INHERENT," EXTRA-CONSTITUTIONAL POWER OVER IMMIGRATION
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The doctrine that the President has "inherent power over immigration deriving its source solely from our nation's sovereignty rather than from the Constitution, and which is unlimited by the Constitution, is alien to our history, our values and our constitutional system.  There is not a scrap of evidence in the text of the Constitution, the records of the Constitutional Convention or the statements of the Framers of the Constitution that even suggests that the President,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*9]\b0 \i0 \ul0   or even Congress, has inherent, extra-constitutional power over immigration or over any other field.  \b0 \i \ul0 See\b0 \i0 \ul0  Note, \b0 \i \ul0 Constitutional Limits on the Power to Exclude Aliens,\b0 \i0 \ul0  82 Colum. L. Rev. 957, 970 n.90 (1982). As Madison explained: "The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and defined." \b0 \i \ul0 The Federalist,\b0 \i0 \ul0  No. 45, at 292 (Madison) (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).  The entire structure of the Constitution shows that it is document which limits executive power.  Indeed, the tenth amendment makes clear that whatever the sovereign power of the nation may be, the only powers which the federal government possesses are those delegated to it by the Constitution and all others are reserved to the states or to the people.  U.S. Const. amend.  X.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Since \b0 \i \ul0 Marbury v. Madison,\b0 \i0 \ul0  5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 176-80 (1803), this Court has repeatedly declared that \b0 \i \ul0 all\b0 \i0 \ul0  powers of the federal government, whether belonging to the President or to Congress, are derived from the Constitution.  \b0 \i \ul0 Reid v. Covert,\b0 \i0 \ul0  354 U.S. 1, 5-6 (1957) (Black, J.) ("The United States is entirely a creature of the Constitution.  Its power and authority \b \i0 \ul0 [*10]\b0 \i0 \ul0   have no other source.") (footnote omitted); \b0 \i \ul0 Ex parte Quirin,\b0 \i0 \ul0  317 U.S. 1, 25 (1942) ("Congress and the President, like the courts, possess no power not derived from the Constitution"); \b0 \i \ul0 Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe,\b0 \i0 \ul0  306 U.S. 466, 477 (1939) ("government derives its authority wholly from powers delegated to it by the Constitution"); \b0 \i \ul0 Martin v. Hunter's Lessee,\b0 \i0 \ul0  14 U.S. (1 Wheat.) 304, 326 (1816) (Marshall, C.J.) ("The government, then, of the United States, can claim no powers which are not granted to it by the constitution . . . .").
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Nearly twenty years ago, this Court confirmed this central principle of American constitutional government when it rejected claims that Congress had inherent power independent of the Constitution "as an implied attribute of sovereignty possessed by all nations" to deprive an American citizen of his citizenship without his assent: "Our Constitution governs us and we must never forget that our Constitution limits the Government to those powers specifically granted or those that are necessary and proper to carry out the specifically granted ones." \b0 \i \ul0 Afroyim v. Rusk,\b0 \i0 \ul0  387 U.S. 253, 257 (1967). \b \i0 \ul0 [*11]\b0 \i0 \ul0   * 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 * Indeed, Justices of this Court have reminded us of this essential principle on other occasions.  \b0 \i \ul0 Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez,\b0 \i0 \ul0  372 U.S. 144, 195-96 (1963) (Brennan, J., concurring) ("[u]nder our Constitution, only a delimited portion of sovereignty has been assigned to the Government of which Congress is the legislative arm.  To say that there inheres in United States sovereignty the power to sever the tie of citizenship does not answer the inquiry into whether that power has been granted to Congress."); \b0 \i \ul0 Reid v. Covert,\b0 \i0 \ul0  354 U.S. 1, 66 (1957) (Harlan, J., concurring in the result) ("To say that the validity of the statute may be rested upon the inherent 'sovereign powers' of this country in its dealings with foreign nations seems to me to be no more than begging the question."); \b0 \i \ul0 Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer,\b0 \i0 \ul0  343 U.S. 579, 646-47, 649-50 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring).
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Although the \b0 \i \ul0 nation\b0 \i0 \ul0  may possess certain powers as a sovereign nation, whatever powers the people gave to the federal government were delegated to it by the Constitution.  The \b0 \i \ul0 federal government\b0 \i0 \ul0  did not receive such powers independently by \b \i0 \ul0 [*12]\b0 \i0 \ul0   virtue of the nation's sovereignty.  Moreover, to say that the nation must possess the power as a sovereign nation does not answer the question whether the people delegated it to the federal government or reserved it to the States or to the people.  Nor does it answer the question whether the people delegated it by the Constitution to Congress or to the President.  Only the Constitution can answer these questions.  And the Constitution's answer is directly contrary to the \b0 \i \ul0 en banc\b0 \i0 \ul0  court's conclusion.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 B.  NO PRECEDENT SUPPORTS THE DOCTRINE THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS CONSTITUTIONALLY UNLIMITED POWER OVER IMMIGRATION
\par \b0 \i \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 All\b0 \i0 \ul0  powers of the federal government, whether exercised by Congress, the courts, the President or, as here, by low-level immigration officials, are limited by the Constitution.  \b0 \i \ul0 Marbury v. Madison,\b0 \i0 \ul0  5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 176-80 (1803) (Marshall, C.J.).  None of the cases cited by the court below supports the doctrine that the President has either statutory or extra-constitutional power over immigration which is \b0 \i \ul0 unlimited\b0 \i0 \ul0  by the Constitution.  Each case involved the power of Congress or the power of the President pursuant to a delegation by Congress \b \i0 \ul0 [*13]\b0 \i0 \ul0   to admit or to deny entry to aliens.  None involved invidious discrimination or incarceration of aliens.  Indeed, in every case involving incarceration of aliens this and other courts have subjected such incarceration to constitutional scrutiny.  Even in the midst of the most extreme emergency -- war -- this Court subjected discriminatory incarceration by the President to strict constitutional scrutiny.  \b0 \i \ul0 Korematsu v. United States,\b0 \i0 \ul0  323 U.S. 214 (1944).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Until the unprecedented decision by the court below, no court has ever held that actions by federal government officials were not subject to \b0 \i \ul0 some\b0 \i0 \ul0  constitutional scrutiny.  Indeed, it is a fundamental principle, as this Court has recognized, that "every . . . governmental power[] must be exercised in subordination to the applicable provisions of the Constitution." \b0 \i \ul0 United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp.,\b0 \i0 \ul0  299 U.S. 304, 320 (1936). \b0 \i \ul0 Accord \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0 Dames & Moore v. Regan,\b0 \i0 \ul0  453 U.S. 654, 661-62 (1981) (Rehnquist, J.); \b0 \i \ul0 Haig v. Agee,\b0 \i0 \ul0  453 U.S. 280, 289 n.17 (1981) (Burger, C.J.).  All powers exercised by the political branches, whether by Congress, the President or low-level \b \i0 \ul0 [*14]\b0 \i0 \ul0   executive officials, are limited by the Constitution.  \b0 \i \ul0 Reid v. Covert,\b0 \i0 \ul0  354 U.S. at 6 ("[The United States] can only act in accordance with all the limitations imposed by the Constitution.") (footnote omitted); \b0 \i \ul0 Marbury v. Madison,\b0 \i0 \ul0  5 U.S. (1 Cranch) at 176-80. Long ago, this Court rejected a similar theory that executive officials during wartime could disregard the Constitution:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Constitution of the United States is a law for rulers and people, equally in war and in peace, and covers with the shield of its protection all classes of men, at all times, and under all circumstances.  No doctrine, involving more pernicious consequences, was ever invented by the wit of man than that any of its provisions can be suspended during any of the great exigencies of government.  Such a doctrine leads directly to anarchy or despotism. . . .

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Not only did the lower court simply disregard this basic principle, but the cases of this and other courts which it cited simply do not support a doctrine of inherent, extra-constitutional Presidential power over immigration.  \b0 \i \ul0 Fong Yue Ting v.

United States, (The Chinese Exclusion Case\b0 \i0 \ul0 ), 130 U.S. 581 (1889) \b \i0 \ul0 [*16]\b0 \i0 \ul0   all involved the power of Congress, not the President, to admit or exclude aliens.  Here, neither the power of Congress, nor the power to admit or deny admission is at issue.  Nevertheless, this Court has held that even the power of Congress over admission is limited by the Constitution.  In \b0 \i \ul0 The Chinese Exclusion Case,\b0 \i0 \ul0  this Court declared that Congress "can exclude aliens," but its power was limited by "the Constitution itself and considerations of public policy and justice which control, more or less, the conduct of all civilized nations." 130 U.S. at 604.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In the two cases on which the court below relies most heavily, \b0 \i \ul0 United States v.

Shaughnessy,\b0 \i0 \ul0  338 U.S. 537 (1950), the statements about the supposed inherent, extra-constitutional powers of the President were not necessary to the decision and unsupported by any authority.  As Justice Jackson recognized, much of the Court's opinion in \b0 \i \ul0 Curtiss-Wright\b0 \i0 \ul0  was \b0 \i \ul0 dicta\b0 \i0 \ul0  since this Court was interpreting the scope of the President's \b0 \i \ul0 delegated\b0 \i0 \ul0  power under a proclamation authorized by a joint resolution \b \i0 \ul0 [*17]\b0 \i0 \ul0   of Congress.  \b0 \i \ul0 Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Similarly, the statement in \b0 \i \ul0 Knauff\b0 \i0 \ul0  that "the power of exclusion of aliens is also inherent in the executive department of the sovereign," 338 U.S. at 543, was not necessary to the decision since the Attorney General was acting pursuant to a congressionally authorized presidential proclamation of an emergency.  Since this presidential proclamation could have been authorized by normal delegation principles, there was no need to search for unprecedented inherent presidential power.  Moreover, the cases cited in support of Justice Minton's conclusion involved \b0 \i \ul0 congressional,\b0 \i0 \ul0  not presidential, power.  In any event, as demonstrated below, subsequent jurisprudence of this Court has squarely rejected the concept of constitutionally unlimited "inherent" presidential power.  **

Such discriminatory incarceration can have no legitimate relationship to admission decisions made pursuant to facially neutral \b \i0 \ul0 [*19]\b0 \i0 \ul0   statutes.  This and other courts consistently subject the incarceration of aliens to constitutional scrutiny.  \b0 \i \ul0 Wong Wing v. United States,\b0 \i0 \ul0  163 U.S. 228 (1896); \b0 \i \ul0 Jean v.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Even in the most extreme emergency possible, the middle of a world war when the President claimed that the nation faced imminent invasion and sabotage, this Court subjected invidiously discriminatory incarceration on the basis of race and national origin by the President to the strictest constitutional scrutiny.  \b0 \i \ul0 Korematsu v. United States,\b0 \i0 \ul0  323 U.S. 214 (1944). A \b0 \i \ul0 fortiori,\b0 \i0 \ul0  if even the discriminatory incarceration by the President acting pursuant to his delegated war power is subject to strict constitutional scrutiny, the discrimination against petitioners here by low-level immigration officials acting in defiance of non-discriminatory presidential and congressional policy must be subject to constitutional \b \i0 \ul0 [*20]\b0 \i0 \ul0   scrutiny.
