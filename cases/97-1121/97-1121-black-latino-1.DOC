\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 STATEMENT OF THE CASE\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 1. Chicago's citizens are united in their determination to combat gangs. Yet the means at issue in this case, the city's anti-loitering ordinance, has evoked substantial community opposition. The ordinance applies to any group of two or more individuals who gather "with no apparent purpose" in any public place, including streets, parks, restaurants, and any other location open to the public. Pet. App. 63a. The ordinance mandates that if a police officer reasonably believes any of the individuals to be a gang member, he shall order all of the individuals, including those not suspected of gang membership, to "disperse and remove themselves from the area"; the officer may then arrest any individual he believes to be disobeying the order.  \b \i0 \ul0 [**7]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Pet. App. 61a.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 City Council consideration of the ordinance was marked by intense disagreement. The Chicago Tribune described the proceedings as "one of the most heated and emotional council debates in recent memory." n6 Concern focused on the fact that the ordinance permits the arrest of those not suspected of gang involvement; that it could be  \b \i0 \ul0 [*4]\b0 \i0 \ul0   read to require minority youth to leave any neighborhood where police think they do not belong; that it limits gatherings not just on street corners but in a wide range of public and privately owned locations; that it restricts groups as small as two or three people; and that it applies regardless of whether any of the individuals is engaged in loud, intimidating or obstructive behavior.

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The ordinance drew both support and opposition from Chicago citizens of all backgrounds. The Chicago chapter of the NAACP denounced the proposal, n7 as did the editorial page of Chicago's leading African-American newspaper, the Chicago Defender. n8 The City's largest newspapers likewise condemned the proposal. The Chicago Tribune noted that \b \i0 \ul0 [**8]\b0 \i0 \ul0   the ordinance would "invite police abuses," and concluded, "if [residents] expect that this new ordinance will make their streets safe, they are bound to be disappointed." n9 The Chicago Sun-Times compared supporters of the ordinance to "the likes of George III and the tyrants of Beijing" and concluded that "the proposed city ordinance to ban loitering by 'known gang members' is too vague, too unworkable and, above all, too unconstitutional." n10

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The City Council hearings established community concern about gangs but also cast doubt on the need for a new ordinance to respond to them. Numerous residents had described the ability of gang members to control street corners and intimidate residents. But Deputy Superintendent Cooper, the CPD representative at the hearings, testified:
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0 there are already enough laws on the books at this point... In the examples that people have been giving, ... 90 percent of those instances are actually criminal offenses where people, in fact, can be arrested.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Cooper's testimony supporting the ordinance was so tepid that one alderman finally asked him, "Bottomline, what is the CPD's position on this ordinance? Do you folks want it or would you just prefer that it not be on the books?" Supp. R. II 185. Although the CPD, as part of the City administration, was officially committed to the proposal, Cooper replied:
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0 Under the appropriate circumstances, the ordinance can  \b \i0 \ul0 [*6]\b0 \i0 \ul0   be a viable tool for the police. What I am suggesting, however, is that there is much more that can be done rather than an additional law on the books, and I would \b \i0 \ul0 [**11]\b0 \i0 \ul0   prefer that the--or I would rather suggest or request the City Council, in its infinite wisdom, begin to look at the totality of the problem as opposed to looking at it from a one-dimensional point of view.

\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n15 In light of Cooper's testimony, petitioner errs in asserting that "this record contains no evidence ... that there were [other] means available to the City to address the problems engendered by gang loitering." Br. 27.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 2. In a series of court proceedings, thirteen trial judges passed on the ordinance. Ten trial judges held the ordinance unconstitutionally vague on its face, and one held it unconstitutional as applied; only two of the trial judges upheld the ordinance. n16 On appeal, the Illinois court of appeals unanimously held the ordinance unconstitutionally vague on its face, in violation of both the Illinois and federal constitutions.

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Illinois Supreme Court unanimously affirmed. The Court noted that the ordinance, as written, would apply to many innocent activities that the City Council could not have intended \b \i0 \ul0 [**12]\b0 \i0 \ul0   to restrict, e.g. waiting to hail a taxi. Pet. App. 10a. The Court accordingly assumed that the ordinance's definition of "loitering" was not intended to restrain all activity falling literally within its terms. Rather, the Court held that "the definition of loitering ... provides absolute discretion to police officers to decide what activities constitute loitering." Pet. App. 15a. The Court further found that because the City Council's intent was to "craft[] an exceptionally broad ordinance which could be used to sweep these intolerable and objectionable gang members from the city streets," the ordinance was not susceptible to a limiting construction. Pet. App. 16a. The Court concluded that the ordinance was "impermissibly vague in all of its applications" (Pet. App. 7a) in violation of the due process requirements of both the Illinois (Pet. App. 6a) and federal constitutions.

\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  \b \i0 \ul0 [*7]\b0 \i0 \ul0   \b \i0 \ul0 SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 1. The Illinois Supreme Court ascertained the legislative purpose of City Council and determined that the ordinance was intentionally cast in "exceptionally broad" terms, Pet. App. 16a, so that police officers would have the power to disperse and, if necessary, arrest \b \i0 \ul0 [**13]\b0 \i0 \ul0   citizens whose behavior they consider objectionable. The Court then held that the ordinance, so construed, violates federal due process requirements. This Court has never overturned a state supreme court's judgment finding its own law impermissibly vague under these circumstances.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 There is no reason to believe that the Illinois trial and appellate judges who ruled in this case are insensitive to the dangers of gang violence or unaware of practical problems that arise in prosecuting gang members under already-existing laws. Nor is there any reason to believe that these state judges felt constrained by federal precedent to invalidate an ordinance that they preferred to uphold. On the contrary, both Illinois appellate courts ruled unanimously that the ordinance violates the Illinois constitution as well.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Faced with a poorly drafted and largely incoherent legislative pronouncement, the Illinois Supreme Court made a reasonable effort to give it an intelligible meaning. The ordinance applies only to those who gather with "no apparent purpose." But if an intent to get fresh air or to observe the passing scene is a "purpose" within the meaning of the ordinance--if no interpretative gloss \b \i0 \ul0 [**14]\b0 \i0 \ul0   restricts the kinds of purposes that can qualify--then, as the Solicitor General concedes, "the ordinance would prohibit nothing at all." Br. U.S. 13. To avoid this result, petitioner suggests that an individual's "apparent purpose" must be "immediately discernible to a police officer." Br. 38. Yet, if given this gloss, the ordinance would constrain many varieties of constitutionally protected religious activity, political organizing, and other acts (e.g., waiting for the chance to hail a taxi) that the City Council could not have intended to restrict. n17 And even with this gloss,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*8]\b0 \i0 \ul0   the ordinance would remain unavailable against its principal targets--known gang members who congregate to assert control over turf or to recruit new members--because these individuals have a readily discernible purpose. With or without petitioner's suggested gloss, the "no apparent purpose" language simultaneously prohibits much more and much less than the City Council could have intended. The Illinois Supreme Court accordingly concluded the "no apparent purpose" language simply served to cast a wide net, so that police officers would have discretion to decide on the spot which activities constitute \b \i0 \ul0 [**15]\b0 \i0 \ul0   the restricted kind of "loitering."
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n17 Contrary to the claim of the Solicitor General (Br. U.S. 13 n.6), the Illinois Supreme Court was not ill-informed about the realities of hailing a cab in the city where it sits. On Chicago streets, many minutes can go by without a taxi passing. See Hill & Downey, "Taxis Still Can Be Rare Despite Law," Chicago Tribune, May 24, 1998, p.1. Persons waiting to hail a cab do not constantly wave their arms in a way that would make their purpose apparent. Other amici make the same error, dismissing the Illinois Supreme Court's example as "nonsensical." Br. Nat'l Dist. Attorneys Ass'n 16. There is nothing nonsensical about waiting until a taxi is within sight before attempting to hail it.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This was the correct interpretation of the ordinance and certainly not an unreasonable one. But even if this Court believes that the ordinance should have been given a narrower or more specific interpretation, that question is not one of federal law. Ascertaining legislative intent and making the prudential judgment whether to impose a narrowing construction on poorly drafted state legislation are quintessential matters of state law, on which the decision of a \b \i0 \ul0 [**16]\b0 \i0 \ul0   state supreme court is final.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The only federal question presented is whether the ordinance, so construed, is unconstitutional. Unless this Court is prepared to abandon the familiar Papachristou-Kolender standard, n18 there can be no doubt that a law is impermissibly vague when its terms leave police officers with substantive discretion to determine, without legislative or administrative guidance, which kinds of public behavior the law restricts.
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n18 Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville, 405 U.S. 156 (1972); Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352 (1983).
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 2. Petitioner argues that vagueness problems are cured because  \b \i0 \ul0 [*9]\b0 \i0 \ul0   an arrest under the ordinance must be preceded by a police order to disperse. But the unique terms of this ordinance's dispersal requirement aggravate vagueness problems. Contrary to petitioner's repeated assertions (Br. 11, 29, 30), it is simply not true that citizens can comply with the dispersal order merely by separating and moving on. The ordinance requires individuals to disperse and "remove themselves from the area." Pet. App. 61a. Even when individuals disperse and move on, they have no way to know how far they must go or how \b \i0 \ul0 [**17]\b0 \i0 \ul0   long they must remain away to avoid arrest. We have found no other law granting--and no judicial decision ever sustaining--any comparable police power to exercise spatial control over movement within a city.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 3. At no time in the past twenty-six years has this Court or any state supreme court ever countenanced a law granting police the degree of untrammeled discretion that results from petitioner's concededly "novel" (Br. U.S. 28 n.19) ordinance. Implicitly recognizing the unprecedented nature of their claims, petitioner and several of its amici urge this Court to modify or abandon the Papachristou-Kolender standard. They argue that new conceptions of community policing and alleged improvements in the voting power of minorities render obsolete the traditional due process limits on police discretion to set substantive standards of behavior. Br. 15; Br. CNO 6, 9-14.

Due process cannot mean one thing when a minority group opposes loitering laws and a different thing when such a group allegedly favors them. Cf.  City of Richmond v. J.A.

See Part IV, infra. Petitioner and its amici offer no justification for abandoning traditional due process principles, and make no showing that courts could manage the complex inquiries into minority-group preferences that would be necessary under the sliding-scale constitutional test that petitioner's amici propose, Br.

But in the formal vote enacting the ordinance, the African-American aldermen split 8-6 against it, and the recent resolution of support was adopted under a suspension of City Council rules, apparently without notice or debate, with eleven African-American aldermen opposed, absent or not voting. City of Chicago, Official Journal, May 20, 1998, pp. 70134-35. The record is clear that support for the ordinance has been sharply divided and that this law has never commanded the support of a majority of the city's African-American aldermen.

And police can assure citizens of the complete confidentiality of such reports, even when the issue of probable cause must later be litigated.  McCray v. Illinois, 386 U.S. 300 (1967).

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 THE ORDINANCE'S DEFINITION OF LOITERING IS IMPERMISSIBLY VAGUE ON ITS FACE.\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 "The void-for vagueness doctrine requires that a penal statute define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited." Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 357 (1983). In addition, the vagueness doctrine requires that the offense be defined "in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement." Id. The Chicago ordinance is impermissibly vague on both grounds. In none of its conceivable applications does it provide fair notice to citizens or sufficient guidance to prevent arbitrary enforcement.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Petitioner insists that the term "loiter" has a readily understood meaning. Br. 30. Yet courts uniformly hold that when statutes prohibit loitering,  \b \i0 \ul0 [**22]\b0 \i0 \ul0   without requiring proof of other elements, they are void for vagueness. n24 The reason is that the concept of "loitering" is either too subjective or too broad to identify prohibited conduct with reasonable definiteness.
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n24 E.g., State v. Richard, 836 P.2d 622 (Nev. 1992); Farber v. Rochford, 407 F. Supp. 529 (N.D. Ill. 1975).
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The ordinary meaning of loitering is inherently subjective. "Loitering" is a pejorative term, signaling disapproval of the activity or the actor. When two senior citizens spend an evening chatting on a park bench, their neighbors would not speak of them as "loitering." But those neighbors would readily apply that label to teenagers from outside the neighborhood or other "undesirables" engaging in precisely the same conduct. A statute is void for vagueness if it proscribes conduct "annoying" to others ( Coates v. City of Cincinnati, 402 U.S. 611 (1971)), even though the word "annoying" has a well understood meaning. For the same reason, the term loitering, as used in everyday conversation, is unacceptably vague for penal law purposes, even if observers of similar age and social background would agree about which activities \b \i0 \ul0 [**23]\b0 \i0 \ul0   deserve that label. The meaning of the word is determined by the personal sensibilities of the observer.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360  \b \i0 \ul0 [*13]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Statutes that define loitering as standing or strolling "with no apparent purpose" seek to eliminate the overtly subjective element, but they then cover so many innocuous activities that they do not identify prohibited conduct at all. Courts uniformly and properly hold such statutes unconstitutional. As a recent FBI publication notes, "courts routinely have held that broadly worded vagrancy and loitering statutes that do not target other unlawful conduct are unconstitutional." n25 Without some additional element or narrowing construction, loitering--so defined--is inherently overbroad, not only in the sense that it can apply to constitutionally protected conduct, but also in the sense that, taken literally, it reaches activity that the legislature clearly had no desire to condemn. Such breadth of apparent coverage renders the statute vague, because the statutory terms afford no basis for distinguishing between conduct that remains permissible and conduct that the law is intended to proscribe.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Papachristou makes this point clear. This Court expressly held that "the qualification 'without any lawful purpose or object' may be a trap for innocent acts." 405 U.S. at 164. Similarly, referring to another provision of the Jacksonville ordinance, this Court said that persons "'habitually . . . frequenting . . . places where alcoholic beverages are sold or served' would literally embrace many members of golf clubs and city clubs." Id. Unconstitutional vagueness resulted not from lack of meaning in the words themselves but from the implausible breadth of their coverage. This Court did not hold that a legislature could not make this conduct a crime; n26 it simply recognized that Jacksonville obviously did not. In such cases, the legislature has impermissibly "set a net large enough to catch all possible offenders." United States v. Reese, 92 U.S. 214, 221 (1875). In effect:

\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0 Definiteness is designedly avoided so as to allow the net to be cast at large, to enable men to be caught who are vaguely undesirable in the eyes of police and prosecution, although not chargeable with any particular offense. In  \b \i0 \ul0 [*14]\b0 \i0 \ul0   short, these 'vagrancy statutes' and laws \b \i0 \ul0 [**25]\b0 \i0 \ul0   against 'gangs' are not fenced in by the text of the statute or by the subject matter so as to give notice of conduct to be avoided.

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Chicago ordinance suffers from the same flaws; its definition of loitering offers no basis for distinguishing between conduct that the City Council intended to restrict and conduct that it intended to leave unfettered. Indeed, though petitioner and its amici insist that loitering has a perfectly clear meaning, they are unable to offer a single internally consistent explanation of what the ordinance covers. If, as petitioner insists, members of a religious group who gather at a street corner and wait for a chance to recruit new members cannot be dispersed, because they have an "apparent purpose" (Br. 20), then the ordinance is likewise inapplicable to gang members who gather at a street corner and wait for an opportunity to recruit new members. A group's purposes are just as likely to \b \i0 \ul0 [**26]\b0 \i0 \ul0   be apparent in one case as in the other. And neither the state nor the City has made it unlawful for gang members to noncoercively recruit new associates. n27
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n27 Compare Ill. Stat. ch. 720 \'a7 5/12-6.1, prohibiting the use of unlawful means to compel a person to join any organization. The behavior that most concerned the City Council--the "visibly lawless" behavior that petitioner repeatedly invokes (Br. 9-10, 12, 14, 16, 27, 44)--is left unrestricted by the ordinance as written, because the purpose of such behavior is apparent. When gang members obstruct the sidewalk or intimidate residents their conduct is addressed by other laws, but the loitering ordinance appears inapplicable and offers no additional tool for prosecuting such cases.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 As written, therefore, the ordinance affords no basis for distinguishing between the organizational activities of various groups. Either it requires officers to disperse Jehovah's Witnesses, Jews for Jesus, and Neighborhood Crime Watch members who gather on street corners to recruit (when any participant is a suspected gang member), or it does not permit officers to disperse Gangster Disciples who gather on street corners to recruit. Neither \b \i0 \ul0 [**27]\b0 \i0 \ul0   interpretation makes much sense or accords even roughly with the City Council's evident intentions. Compare Pet.App. 60a-61a.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360  \b \i0 \ul0 [*15]\b0 \i0 \ul0   These anomalies could be avoided by assuming that the ordinance contemplates a selective determination of which "apparent purposes" count. Yet neither the ordinance nor the implementing General Order offers any standard for making selective judgments about different "apparent purpose[s]." In fact, petitioner takes flatly contradictory positions on the question whether the "apparent purpose" inquiry can be selective. At one point petitioner suggests that persons "who are merely sitting on a park bench [or] chatting on a sidewalk" are subject to the ordinance (Br. 38); apparently, a readily apparent purpose to sit, chat, or engage in "mere casual social interaction" (Br. 10) does not count. At another point, however, petitioner appears to insist that any apparent purpose can qualify, a position that drives it to the astonishing conclusion that "under the ordinance, gang members remain free to ... solicit contributions for their gangs" because this conduct "has an 'apparent purpose.'" Br. 27. Petitioner's view--that gang members are free to gather \b \i0 \ul0 [**28]\b0 \i0 \ul0   at street corners and politely ask each passing citizen to give five dollars to their gang--would surely surprise City Council supporters of the law. Indeed petitioner's interpretation, if sound, renders the ordinance virtually unenforceable--that interpretation apparently permits gang members congregating on a street corner to avoid arrest simply by wearing lapel buttons saying, "This is our turf," or "Give generously to the Gangster Disciples." n28
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n28 No doubt there are cases in which teenagers approached by the police say they were "doing nothing." They presumably mean they were doing nothing wrong; few would realize that this response puts them in jeopardy under the ordinance. If a teenager's "doing nothing" statement constitutes an admission of "loitering," the ordinance sets an especially effective trap for the unwary.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Some of petitioner's examples suggest a different rule of interpretation: that productive purposes qualify, but that purposes to remain idle or to talk informally for reasons of rest or recreation do not. n29 That interpretation likewise creates untenable anomalies. It  \b \i0 \ul0 [*16]\b0 \i0 \ul0   means that the ordinance would not reach conduct that the City Council surely \b \i0 \ul0 [**29]\b0 \i0 \ul0   hoped to cover (e.g., gang efforts to control territory and recruit new members, see Supp.R.II at 32). At the same time, the ordinance would cover much conduct that the City Council presumably did not intend to reach. If casual purposes cannot count, then there is "loitering" when two sweethearts stand holding hands at a street corner after school, when three boys stand outside a movie theater discussing which show to see, when four teenagers stand across the street from their school waiting until the end of lunch hour, or when two senior citizens sit on a park bench chatting with their teenaged grandson. The ordinance, as written, would require a police officer to order these citizens to separate from one another and leave "the area" whenever one of them is reasonably believed to belong to a gang.
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n29 See Br. 10, stating that "mere casual social interaction" cannot count as a qualifying purpose. Partly contradicting this approach, petitioner declares that not all social purposes will be treated equally; a purpose to play basketball allegedly qualifies as an "apparent purpose" but a purpose to chat with a friend does not. Br. 38. One can readily imagine borderline cases--merely watching the basketball game might not qualify as a permissible purpose, or perhaps watching the game would qualify but merely talking about basketball would not. But the fundamental problem is more basic: even in core situations, the application of the ordinance is inevitably debatable.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  \b \i0 \ul0 [**30]\b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In observing that such activities are "innocent" (Pet. App. 9a), the Illinois Supreme Court never suggested that such activities are immune from regulation. Here, as in Papachristou, the problem is not that a legislature could not condemn such activities but simply that it did not--that the legislature could not have intended to restrict such activities and that the language enacted "fails to distinguish between innocent conduct and conduct calculated to cause harm." Pet. App. 9a (emphasis added).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 As a result, the Chicago ordinance simply casts a wide net without identifying which activities the legislative body intended to reach. Such an ordinance "does not provide for government by clearly defined laws, but rather for government by the moment-to-moment opinions of a policeman on his beat." Cox v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 536, 579 (1965) (opinion of Black, J.). By authorizing police action against whichever kinds of idle behavior police view with disapproval, the Chicago ordinance is for practical purposes identical to the ordinance condemned in Coates, providing an "obvious invitation to discriminatory enforcement against those whose association together is 'annoying.'"  \b \i0 \ul0 [**31]\b0 \i0 \ul0   402 U.S. at 616.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360  \b \i0 \ul0 [*17]\b0 \i0 \ul0   The ordinance also threatens core First Amendment interests. If casual social interaction cannot count as an "apparent purpose," the ordinance then applies to the politician or would-be politician who chats casually with neighborhood residents, in periods between formal campaigns, with the unstated goal of building rapport with potential voters. Yet if the ordinance does not apply in this situation, it provides no standard for determining which casual social conversations constitute loitering and which do not. n30 And these difficulties of interpretation do not arise only at the margins. In every imaginable example, the ordinance requires police to make substantive policy judgments in order to avoid the odd results that would follow from applying its terms literally. The Illinois Supreme Court clearly was correct in holding that the ordinance sets no intelligible standard and in effect simply delegates "absolute discretion to police officers to decide what activities constitute loitering." Pet. App. 15a.
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n30 In the case of a known politician, police might decide that a casual social interaction with constituents qualifies as an "apparent purpose," but they would be much less likely to reach that conclusion in the case of someone they do not recognize as a political contender. Discrimination against political novices and outsiders is inherent in the "apparent purpose" inquiry.

\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0 city council's intent ... is clear and unambiguous. The city has declared gang members a public menace...

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In the context of Chicago's ordinance, the gang membership element does nothing to meet the Papachristou-Kolender requirement of adequate limits on law enforcement discretion. As we have discussed, the ordinance and the General Order provide police officers untrammeled discretion to determine which activities constitute loitering. And even when limited to groups that include a suspected gang member, the ordinance requires the exercise of unguided discretion to determine its scope. It provides no standard for determining when a probable gang member may stand \b \i0 \ul0 [**34]\b0 \i0 \ul0   with others watching a ball game in a park or wait with his sister for a chance to  \b \i0 \ul0 [*19]\b0 \i0 \ul0   hail a taxi. It provides no standard for determining whether an aspiring politician may chat casually with a group in which the probable gang member is standing, or whether the gang member's own mother may sit with him on a park bench or stand outside with him on a hot night. Plainly, as the Illinois Supreme Court held, the ordinance contemplates the need for police discretion to determine on the spot which activities constitute the restricted kind of loitering.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 It is true that this discretion can be deployed only in certain areas (undisclosed areas) of the city, n32 and only against some of the population--those who come in contact with suspected gang members. Petitioner in effect argues that discretion to determine allowable forms of public behavior is sufficiently limited if it can be deployed only in certain neighborhoods or only against certain classes of innocent people, people who are not themselves suspected of gang membership or any misbehavior. Yet this Court has never before suggested that it would uphold an ordinance that "does not provide for government by clearly defined laws,  \b \i0 \ul0 [**35]\b0 \i0 \ul0   but rather for government by the moment-to-moment opinions of a policeman on his beat," Cox, 379 U.S. at 579 (opinion of Black, J.), on condition that this form of government be placed in effect only in designated but undisclosed sections of a city. n33 The Illinois Supreme Court should not be faulted  \b \i0 \ul0 [*20]\b0 \i0 \ul0   for concluding that all segments of Chicago's law-abiding population have the same right to be governed by ascertainable law.

The Solicitor General appears to be misinformed on this point. The Solicitor General asserts that citizens "may stand wherever they wish in areas of the city not designated by the general order." Br.

In cities where police lists of probable gang members have been analyzed, substantial portions of the city's African-American youth appear on such lists. In Los Angeles, 47% of the city's African-American youth, and in Denver 67% have been placed on police lists of probable gang members. Stolberg, "150,000 Are in Gangs, Report by D.A.

As a result, virtually any group of inner-city minority youth is likely to contain at least one person whom police consider a gang member. For these youth, the right to stand on the street will therefore exist "only at the whim of any police officer of the city," Shuttlesworth v. City of Birmingham, 382 U.S. 87. 90 (1965) (or technically, any officer designated to enforce the ordinance), provided only that the group is considered to be "loitering."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Standardless discretion is precisely what the ordinance gives Chicago's police, as we have shown. But even if the preconditions for issuing a dispersal order were precise, the ordinance would still be vague, because the terms of the dispersal requirement are fatally ambiguous.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Petitioner asserts repeatedly that under the ordinance "people are told precisely what they must do to avoid arrest," and that "no one could fail to understand what is required of him," because the ordinance merely requires individuals to obey a police order to "disperse" or to "move on." Br. 11, 29, 30. This characterization of the ordinance \b \i0 \ul0 [**37]\b0 \i0 \ul0   is incorrect. Both the ordinance and the General Order require an arrest unless the members of the group promptly disperse and "remove themselves from the area." Pet. App. 61a, 72a.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360  \b \i0 \ul0 [*21]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Far from curing the vagueness of the other sections of the ordinance, the obligation to leave "the area" introduces additional vagueness. As the Illinois court of appeals noted, "the ordinance and general order are also completely silent as to exactly how fast and how far the persons have to disperse in order to avoid arrest." Pet. App. 32a-33a. Yet petitioner's brief offers no defense of the ordinance's leave-the-area requirement. n34
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n34 That requirement is nowhere mentioned in petitioner's brief, except where the brief sets out the full text of the ordinance. Br. 4. The vagueness of the leave-the-area requirement was a ground of decision in the Illinois court of appeals, and respondents expressly argued the issue in the Illinois Supreme Court, Br. Resp. Ill. S. Ct. 46-47. As one group of petitioner's amici recognizes, the issue is properly before this Court. Br. Nat'l Dist. Attorneys Ass'n., et al. 24.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360  Kolender v. Lawson, supra, makes clear that a police order to leave \b \i0 \ul0 [**38]\b0 \i0 \ul0   "the area" is fatally vague. Kolender involved a California statute providing penalties for any person who "loiters or wanders . . . without apparent reason ... and refuses to identify himself ... when requested to do so ...." 461 U.S. at 353 n.1. In Kolender the California courts had narrowed the loitering provision by holding that an officer could request identification only when he had "reasonable suspicion of criminal activity sufficient to justify a Terry detention." Id., 356. The state courts had also ruled that the identification provided by the suspect had to be "credible and reliable." This Court assumed that the Terry suspicion standard adequately guided the officer's discretion whether to request identification but nonetheless ruled the California law void on its face, because it "contains no standard for determining what a suspect has to do in order to satisfy the [identification] requirement." Id. 358.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The same vagueness problem arises in more acute form here. The Chicago ordinance applies to innocent citizens not suspected of illegal conduct or gang membership; as we have shown, it contains no standards for determining when a \b \i0 \ul0 [**39]\b0 \i0 \ul0   dispersal order can be issued; and it contains no standard for determining how far an individual must go or how long he must remain away in order to comply with the order. Nor is any such standard to be found elsewhere in Illinois law. To the contrary, Illinois precedent warns that "standing alone the word 'area' [in a statute] implies nothing as to size. It may be of large or small extent." Illinois Cent. R. Co. v. Village of South Pekin,  \b \i0 \ul0 [*22]\b0 \i0 \ul0   374 Ill. 431, 435, 29 N.E. 2d 590, 593 (1940). The leave-the-area requirement thus adds uncertainty for citizens seeking to comply with the law and provides a layer of added discretion for officers who are authorized to decide with no guidance whether an individual has left "the area." Even when a group has dispersed and begun to move away, each individual remains subject to arrest if he fails to move far enough, or returns to "the area" too soon.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The puzzling arrest statistics reported by the CPD seem less surprising in this light. From 1992 until 1995, police issued 85, 197 orders to disperse, and in 49% of these cases, police decided that individuals were disobeying their orders; 41,740 individuals were arrested. n35 \b \i0 \ul0 [**40]\b0 \i0 \ul0   If the order to disperse is as clear and easy to satisfy as petitioner claims, such a high rate of noncompliance is inexplicable. It is not likely that so many young gang members were defiantly defending their "turf" against armed officers, or that they welcomed the chance to spend time in Cook County Jail. Common sense suggests that many of these young persons wanted to avoid arrest but failed in their efforts to comply. The obligation to leave an unspecified "area" is so ambiguous that it "creates a trap for the wary as well as the unwary." Gentile v. State Bar of Nevada, 501 U.S. 1030, 1051 (1991) (opinion of Kennedy, J.).

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Chicago's leave-the-area requirement appears to be unique. The great majority of relevant state laws authorize only a police order to disperse or move on. n36 A few state laws authorize orders with some spatial component, such as orders to "depart" or "leave." But in all the examples we have found, such orders to leave can be issued only under narrowly defined circumstances such as riot or accident. n37 Such  \b \i0 \ul0 [*23]\b0 \i0 \ul0   orders automatically \b \i0 \ul0 [**41]\b0 \i0 \ul0   acquire content by reference to the emergency itself; a law-abiding person can readily understand the expectation that he move out of sight and earshot.

\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n36 Among the forty-one "State Dispersal Laws" cited by amici Ohio, et al. (Br. Ohio A-4 to A-8), thirty-three authorize only an order to "disperse," "move" or "move on"; the only cited laws with a spatial component ("depart," "leave" or "withdraw") are those of Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire and Wisconsin, while Ohio's statute requires obedience to any "lawful order." See id., and statutes there cited.
\par \fs20 \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n37 The Ohio statute, for example, applies only in cases of "fire, accident, disaster, riot or emergency." Id. A-7. Each of the other state statutes authorizing an order to depart or leave is similarly limited. See id. A-5 to A-8 and statutes there cited.
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Here, in contrast, there is no indication that moving out of sight of a particular street corner would constitute leaving "the area." If the "area" concept has any content, in the present context, it might mean leaving "the neighborhood," a locale that is not only vague but also, in Chicago, closely tied to race and ethnicity. n38 A \b \i0 \ul0 [**42]\b0 \i0 \ul0   law authorizing police to order strangers back to their own neighborhood would make all-too-real the concerns of Chicago aldermen who compared this ordinance to South Africa's pass laws. n39 In the Chicago setting, such a law could not easily survive equal protection scrutiny, and petitioner does not suggest that the "area" concept should be so understood. Yet if an "area" cannot be equated with a neighborhood, it remains totally unclear what its limits are or what criteria might be used determine them.

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 No decision of this Court, or of any state court we have discovered, has ever permitted any comparable police power to exercise spatial control over movement within a city.  Cox v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 559 (1965), where this Court reversed a conviction for demonstrating "near" a courthouse, offers an instructive contrast. The Court assumed that the term near "may not [be] unconstitutionally vague, at least as applied to a demonstration within the sight and \b \i0 \ul0 [**43]\b0 \i0 \ul0   hearing of those in the courthouse." In reaching that conclusion, the Court stressed that the statute permitted "a degree of on-the-spot administrative interpretation" and held that "this administrative discretion to construe the term 'near' concerns a limited control of the streets and other areas in the immediate vicinity of the courthouse  \b \i0 \ul0 [*24]\b0 \i0 \ul0   and is the type of narrow discretion which this Court has recognized as ... proper." Id. 568-69. n40 No comparable measuring rod is implicit in the Chicago ordinance. It applies at numerous undisclosed locations, is not limited to the immediate vicinity of any point, and does not contemplate any on-the-spot guidance to indicate what the citizen must do to comply.
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n40 All of this Court's decisions emphasize comparable limitations.  Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104 (1972), held that a law prohibiting noise in any area "adjacent" to a school was not vague because "there must be demonstrated interference with school activities." Id. at 114. Colten v. Kentucky, 407 U.S. 104 (1972), held that a police order was not vague where it required Colton to leave a place where police were investigating a traffic violation and where conviction required "the intent of causing inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm." Id. at 110. Boos v. Barry, 485 U.S. 312 (1988), upheld a law prohibiting demonstrations within 500 feet of an embassy. In all such cases the spatial scope of the legal requirement is readily ascertainable.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Such an ordinance is void on its face because it is vague in all its applications. It is true that a citizen who stands his ground cannot plausibly claim to have left the area. But Kolender presented the same question. As Justice White argued there in dissent (461 U.S. at 472), the Kolender statute was clear as applied to the defiant citizen who refused to provide any identification. This Court considered Justice White's example irrelevant to a facial challenge. As Kolender holds, due process requires that laws, however ambiguous at their edges, offer some safe harbor for the law-abiding citizen who seeks to comply. In the Kolender setting there were no objective standards the officer could apply, once identification was offered, to determine whether it was "credible."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Chicago ordinance poses the same problem, in more acute form. Short of fleeing the jurisdiction, the person who tries to comply has no way to know how far he must go or how long he must remain away in order to avoid arrest. n41 Independent of every other vagueness problem, the leave-the-area requirement violates Kolender's principle  \b \i0 \ul0 [*25]\b0 \i0 \ul0   that a police officer's order must have ascertainable content \b \i0 \ul0 [**45]\b0 \i0 \ul0   and afford the citizen a reasonable opportunity to comply.
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n41 One option would be for him to go home, but if his home is his only safe harbor, then the ordinance in effect permits the police to impose house arrest without trial, for an indeterminate period, on any citizen found in public with a person reasonably believed to be a gang member. Petitioner has not attempted to defend the ordinance on this basis.

Br. CNO 6. In other cases, they argue, this Court should replace existing principles with a sliding scale of review that would "depend on how widely the burden of that law is likely to be felt" (id. 9), taking into account such factors as "the relationship between the supporters \b \i0 \ul0 [**46]\b0 \i0 \ul0   of the law and those to whom it is being applied."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Petitioner misapprehends the thrust of this academic literature; the critique of state caselaw that these commentators voice is important but narrow. These commentators condemn broad laws against loitering and reserve their criticism for judicial decisions that sometimes misapply Papachristou-Kolender by requiring overly strict proof of criminal intent or other elements that modern laws use to ensure clarity in laws against loitering. n45 Far from questioning the Papachristou-Kolender standard, the leading proponents of community policing all emphasize the importance of continuing to limit police discretion to set substantive standards of acceptable public behavior.

\par \pard \ql \li600\ri600 \sb0 \fi0 In fact, the ideas presented in 'Broken Windows' were antithetical to the use of 'streetsweeping' tactics targeted on 'undesirables'; rather, they advocated close collaboration between police and citizens, including street people, in the development of neighborhood standards... [Yet] the distinction between order maintenance and 'streetsweeping' was not always apparent to police ... One attempt at implementing an order-maintenance approach conducted in Chicago in 1982 used police officers brought in on overtime assignments to sweep through troubled areas and arrest youths congregating on streets. While these sweeps may have been directed against disorder, they did not constitute order maintenance of the ilk Wilson and Kelling had in mind in 'Broken Windows' ... Clearly, all police actions involved in order maintenance would have to be grounded in law and subject  \b \i0 \ul0 [*27]\b0 \i0 \ul0   to clear constitutional constraints against infringement of individual liberties. n46
