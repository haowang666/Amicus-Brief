Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc., is a non-profit corporation established under the laws of the State of New York.  It was formed to assist black persons to secure their constitutional rights by the prosecution of lawsuits.  Its charter declares that its purposes include rendering legal services gratuitously to black persons suffering injustice by reason of racial discrimination.  For many years attorneys of the Legal Defense Fund have represented parties in litigation before this Court and the lower courts involving a variety of race discrimination issues regarding employment.  See, e.g., Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424 (1971); Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 747 (1976). The Legal Defense Fund believes that its experience in such litigation and the research it has done will assist the Court in this case.  The parties have consented to the filing of this brief and letters of consent have been filed with the Clerk.

For more than 69 years, the League and its predecessors have addressed themselves to the problems of disadvantaged minorities in the United States by improving the working conditions of blacks and other minorities, and by fostering better race relations and increasing understanding among all persons.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The National Bankers Association, a nonprofit organization incorporated in 1972 under the laws of the District of Columbia, was founded in 1927 as the National Negro Bankers Association.  The National Bankers Association is a national trade organization for minority-owned and controlled banks.  The purpose of the Association include strengthening minority financial institutions so that they can, in turn, promote economic progress in minority communities and by minority businesses.  The Association has a particular interest in this case because of its possible impact on ongoing federal efforts to increase government deposits in minority banks.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The National Bar Association founded in 1925, is a professional membership organization which represents more than 10,000 black attorneys, judges and law students in the United States.  Its purposes include achieving equal opportunities for minorities in the legal profession, and protecting the civil and political rights of all citizens.  The Association has a particular interest in this case because of its belief in the importance of affirmative action as a means of solving America's racial problems.  The Association's officers are Robert L. Harris (President), William A. Borders, Jr. (President-Elect), George R. Burrell, Jr., Warren H. Dawson, Stuart J.

\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The use of racial classifications for benign purposes is constitutionally permissible where it serves important purposes and does not represent a slur or stigma on any group.  That construction of the Fourteenth Amendment, advanced by four members of the Court in Regents of University of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 361 (1978), was supported by two additional Justices in United Jewish Organizations v. Carey, 430 U.S. 144, 164 (1977). This standard is consistent with the legislative \b \i0 \ul0 [*6]\b0 \i0 \ul0   history of the Amendment, which was framed and approved by the same Congress that adopted a number of race-conscious laws designed to ameliorate the condition of blacks.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The fact that the MBE provision was not considered during the hearings on the 1977 Public Works Act is not fatal to its validity.  The exigencies of the then-existing economic circumstances compelled Congress to act with extraordinary speed to enact the 1977 Act, and precluded as a practical matter inquiry into the experience of minorities under the 1976 Public Works Act.  Minority set-asides were by 1977 a remedial device already in use by and familiar to the federal and state governments.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The debates on the MBE clause reveal that it was intended to overcome both present discrimination and the continuing effects of past discrimination against minority businesses and minority employees.  Each of these problems had been the subject of repeated and exhaustive past congressional hearings and reports, which supported the decision of Congress.  Proponents of the clause also maintained that it alone would suffice to resolve the problems with which it was concerned.  While this conclusion was not essential to the clause's \b \i0 \ul0 [*7]\b0 \i0 \ul0   validity, it too was fully supported by past congressional hearings and reports.
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 ARGUMENT
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 I. THE APPLICABLE CONSTITUTIONAL STANDARD
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Resolution of the instant case requires a determination of the standard by which to measure the constitutionality of a racial classification established for a benign reason.  This issue was considered but not finally decided in Regents of University of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265 (1978). In Bakke only five members of the Court reached this question; four expressly rejected the traditional strict scrutiny test, holding instead that such a classification need only meet three less stringent requirements: (1) there must be "an important and articulated purpose for its use," (2) it must not "stigmatize any group," (3) it must not "singl[e] out those least well represented in the political process to bear the brunt of a benign program." 438 U.S. at 361 (opinion of Justices Brennan, White, Marshall and Blackmun).  The usual strict scrutiny test was also rejected by two additional members of the Court in United Jewish Organizations v. Carey, 430 U.S. 144 (1977). Part IV of Justice White's opinion in that \b \i0 \ul0 [*8]\b0 \i0 \ul0   case, which was joined in by Justices Stevens and Rehnquist, upheld as consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment the race-conscious drawing of district lines so long as such a plan represented no "racial slur or stigma with respect to whites or any other race." 430 U.S. at 165. This seems identical to the second requirement listed by the plurality opinion in Bakke. Thus a benign racial classification which satisfied the three requirements of the Bakke plurality would appear to command the support of a sixmember majority of the Court. n1 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n1 The standards in Bakke and United Jewish Organizations are not literally the same, although as a practical matter a classification failing the first or third Bakke requirement would probably fail as well the UJO test.  The distinction between these standards does not affect the disposition of the instant case, and would not affect the validity of the racial classifications with which we are familiar.  Accordingly we take no position on these alternative articulations of the underlying rule.  
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This constitutional standard is strongly supported by the legislative history of the Fourteenth Amendment, which we set out at length in \b \i0 \ul0 [*9]\b0 \i0 \ul0   our brief Amicus Curiae in Bakke. n2 See 438 U.S. at 396-98 (Marshall, J.) That history reveals that the Congress which framed the Fourteenth Amendment contemporaneously debated and overwhelmingly approved a variety of programs limited to blacks, and regarded the Amendment as providing a constitutional basis for such programs.

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In the years immediately preceding and following the framing of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Congress which authored that provision also enacted a series of race-conscious social programs.  The combined impact of these programs was far greater than the affirmative action measures which have come before this Court.  The racial classifications in those nineteenth century programs were far more exclusive than the measures common today; they were either limited to blacks alone, or included within their ambit only blacks and a nominal number of white loyalists who had fled the South. n3 The 1865 Freedmen's Bureau Act n4 established the Bureau to provide provisions, clothing and fuel for freedmen, to lease \b \i0 \ul0 [*10]\b0 \i0 \ul0   and ultimately sell to them up to 40 acres of land, and to "control . . . all subjects" relating to freedmen.  Although the Bureau's authority also extended to white refugees, neither Congress n5 nor historians n6 regarded this provision as important, and the Bureau's programs, as Congress was aware, were in operation usually limited to freedmen. n7 The 1866 Freedmen's Bureau Act, enacted over President Johnson's veto, authorized educational programs which were expressly limited to "freedmen. n8 In 1867 Congress appropriated funds "for the relief of freedmen or destitute colored people in the District of Columbia, n9 with no provision for aid to destitute whites.  In the same year Congress enacted the Colored Servicemen's Claim Act, providing for black veterans, and for them alone, special assistance in obtaining funds owed them by the government. n10 The Freedmen's Bureau's programs for blacks were ultimately phased out by Congress on the assumption that its work would be continued by the states, an expectation that went unfulfilled for a century.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The racial classifications in this early legislation did not go unnoticed, but were the source of repeated but ineffective opposition in the Congress and on the part of President Johnson, who twice vetoed the 1866 Freedmen's Bureau bill on that basis. n11 The arguments voiced in vain against this legislation closely resemble the contentions raised against affirmative action programs in our own time.  Characterizing these measures as "class legislation", n12 opponents objected that no comparable aid was being provided to equally needy whites. n13

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Proponents of such race-conscious legislation, however, successfully argued that such race-conscious legislation was justified by the special needs of blacks n19 and in the long term interest of all citizens. n20 They emphasized that those special needs were the result of a long history of discrimination, and that the aid would help blacks to become self-supporting. n22 A distinction was drawn between such benign raceconscious measures and invidious discrimination.

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 One object of this bill is to ameliorate the condition of the colored men . . ..  [Its opponents assert] the bill provides one law for one class of men, and another for another class.  The very object of the bill is to break down the discrimination between whites and blacks.  Therefore I repeat that the true object of this bill is the amelioration of the condition of the colored people. n23 This distinction was apparently \b \i0 \ul0 [*14]\b0 \i0 \ul0   accepted by the majority of Congress, which consistently voted to adopt such race-conscious legislation. 
\par \pard 
\par \fs16 \pard \ql \li600\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 n23 Id. at 631-32 (remarks of Rep. Moulton).  
\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Fourteenth Amendment was fashioned and approved by the same Congress which had consistently adopted legislation with such "ameliorative" racial classifications.  The Amendment was adopted in part to remove doubts as to the constitutionality of the Freedmen's Bureau bills, n24 which President Johnson had argued exceeded the authority of Congress. n25 The Freedmen's Bureau Act of 1866, the Reconstruction measure which probably contained the most important race-specific provisions, was considered and approved by Congress simultaneously with the Fourteenth Amendment. n26 the same legislators who comprised the two-thirds majority necessary to override President Johnson's second veto of the Freedmen's Bureau bill also comprised the two- thirds majority that approved the Fourteenth Amendment.  Of the 33 Senators and 104 Representatives who voted to override that veto, every one who was present for the vote also supported the Fourteenth Amendment. n27 Congressman Stevens, introducing the Fourteenth Amendment to the House, described \b \i0 \ul0 [*15]\b0 \i0 \ul0   its basic purpose as providing for "the amelioration of the condition of the freedmen."n28 These were the exact words used only three months earlier to describe the Freedmen'sBureau bill. n29 This identity of phrasing underlines the perceived compatibility of the two measures.  The supporters of the Act and Amendment regarded them as both consistent and complimentary, while opponents viewed the two, together with the Civil Rights Act of 1866, as part of a single coherent, though in their view undesiraable, policy. n30

The debates in that Congress have an uncannily modern tone; the opposition to race-specific remedies was expressed in much the same terms as the contemporary arguments against measures such as the minority set-aside program.  But the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment clearly regarded it as not merely permitting, but affirmatively authorizing such programs.  Many of the race-conscious provisions adopted dealt with the problems of black farmers, the most important group of minority businessmen in nineteentch century America.  In assessing that ameliorative legislation, the Thirty-Ninth Congress applied no special stringent standard, but inquired only whether it was reasonably calculated to serve an ameliorative purpose.  That is the standard which this Court should apply in assessing the constitutionality of such measures.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 II. THE ORIGIN OF THE MBE PROVISION
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The petitioners \b \i0 \ul0 [*17]\b0 \i0 \ul0   focus their constitutional attack on the MBE provision on the congressional processes leading to its adoption, claiming that the lack of hearings on this provision is unjustifiable and virtually fatal to its validity.  They regard the adoption of that measure in 1977 on the floors of the House and Senate as inexplicable and hasty, representing merely a seizure of federal funds for the black community to which the majority of Congress incomprehensibly, and erroneously, agreed.  We suggest that the actual origin of the MBE provision is somewhat different.  In adopting the 1977 Act, Congress was required to act with extraordinary speed to deal with the critical economic situation.  Hearings concerning the experience of minorities under the 1976 Act were not possible because implemtation of that statute was only just beginning.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The Public Works Acts of 1976 and 1977 were adopted to address problems created by the recession which began in 1974, the worst economic downturn which the country had suffered in the past \b \i0 \ul0 [*18]\b0 \i0 \ul0   40 years.  Following the lifting of wage-price controls, and spurred by the dramatic increase in oil prices in early 1974, the annual inflation rate of the consumer price index rose from 3.4% in 1972 to 8.8% in 1973 and 12.2% in 1974. n31 The Federal Reserve Board, with the support of the administration, raised the discount rate from 4.5% in 1972 to 7.8% in 1974, in the hope of cooling off the economy. n32 This in turn caused the prime rate to rise in the same period from 5.25% to the then unheard of level of 10.81%. n33 This greatly increased the cost of borrowing, slowing down capital investment, which fell 12% in real terms in 1974. n34 Higher interest rates, together with the reduction in bank deposits due to the higher rates of return available elsewhere, reduced housing starts by 34% in that year. n35 These events combined to produce in 1974 a reduction in the gross national product, and an increase in the unemployment rate from 4.9% to 5.6%. n36

Unemployment benefits in 1975 had totaled $ 16.8 billion, and were on the verge of bankrupting several state unemployment agencies.  In these difficult circumstances a debate began as to whether federal policies should continue to focus on the problem of inflation, at the risk of continuing the recession, or should emphasize instead stimulating the economy and reducing unemployment.  The President urged the former appriach, while a majority of Congress supported the latter.  To implement its preferred policy Congress began work on a public works program, which would inject additional funds into the economy and which permitted the focusing of those funds on the construction industry, particularly hard hit by the recession.  Congress adopted in July 1976, over the President's veto, the Local Public Works Capital Development and Investment Act of 1976.  90 Stat. 889. The 1976 Act mandated the granting of $ 2 billion in aid to state and local governments.  The effectiveness \b \i0 \ul0 [*20]\b0 \i0 \ul0   of this program required that the funds be spent immediately, while the economy was still struggling to pull out of the recession, and that they be spent over a short period of time so as not to dissipate their stimulative effect.  Congress therefore required the Economic Development Administration ("EDA") to publish implementing regulations within 30 days, 42 U.S.C.  \'a7 6706, and to act on any application within 60 days, 42 U.S.C.  \'a7 6706, and provided that any project for which funds were awarded must begin within 90 days of EDA approval, 42 U.S.C.  \'a7 6705(d). n39

It was also aware, however, as was Congress, that time was of the essence; if additional federal spending were to have the desired effect, it had to occur while the economy was still in its then sluggish condition.  If the funds were not actually expended until after a healthy growth rate had begun, those funds, far from helping the economy, would tend to overheat it and cause increased inflation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Accordingly, both the incoming administration and the Congress acted with unprecedented but essential speed.  On January 4, 1977, Congressman Roe, chairman of the Economic Development Subcommittee of the House Public Works Committee, introduced H 78, calling for an additional $ 4 billion in public works expenditures. n44 On January 7, 1977, the President-elect met with congressional leaders and agreed upon an economic stimulus package that included that $ 4 billion for emergency public works. n45 A similar bill was introduced in the Senate on January 25 by Senator Randolph. n46 The details of the administration's proposals became known the next day. n47 On January 27, the Secretary of the Treasury testified in support of the stimulus package, urging that the funds \b \i0 \ul0 [*23]\b0 \i0 \ul0   should be spent "as quickly as good management allows" and that "speed is clearly of the essence." n48 The President's Message on the Economic Recovery Act stressed "the need for an immediate stimulus to government purchasing power" and urged "prompt" action. n49 House n50 and Senate n51 hearings on the proposals were completed on February 4, 1977, barely a month after the proposal was introduced in the House, and only 10 days after its introduction in the Senate.  The House report was issued on February 16, 1977, and the bill reached the floor and was passed on February 24, 1977. n52 The Senate Report was released on March 4, 1977, and the Senate approved the bill 6 days later. n53

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 It was in the context of this widely recognized need for extraordinarily prompt action, resulting in the enactment of a major piece of legislation with virtually unprecedented but clearly essential speed, that the MBE provision was added to the bill.  Under the 1976 Public Works Act the first grants were only announced on December 26, 1976. n57 The House and Senate hearings held barely a month later dealt almost exclusively with the formulas and criteria used to pick the projects chosen on December 26, 1976.  To a significant degree these formulas and criteria, which were widely criticized as directing funds to areas with very little unemployment, were known from regulations issued by EDA well prior to December.  On the other hand, because the first grants to state and local governments \b \i0 \ul0 [*26]\b0 \i0 \ul0   were only announced in late December, the process of letting of contracts by those governments could only commence after that date, and those contracts generally required a time-consuming competitive bidding process; thus the actual awarding of contracts was only just beginning on February 4, 1977, when the congressional hearings ended.  The hiring of the workers who ultimately received employment under the 1976 Act was only to occur later yet.  And although EDA kept detailed statistics on which cities and states won grants, it does not appear to have had similar data available regarding the race of contractors or their employees. n58

Because of the dispatch with which it was enacted, funds for the 1977 Public Works Act became available in the late spring and early summer of 1977, when the unemployment rate averaged over 7% and the inflation rate was falling to under 5%.  But had the Act been delayed six months, it probably would have been counter productive.  By January 1978, the unemployment rate had fallen to 6.3%, n59 total unemployment had fallen by 800,000, n60 and inflation was up to 9.6%. n61 In 1978 the administration shifted its economic policies away from stimulation of the economy, reducing federal spending and tightening fiscal and monetary policies. n62 Thus the delay required for an inquiry into the administration of the 1976 Public Works Act would have defeated the entire purpose of the 1977 Act.

The amendment was offered by Congressman Mitchell, rather than by Congressman Conyers, apparently because Mitchell was the leading House proponent of minority business enterprises, and had less than a month before he offered a bill to require that virtually all federal procurement and construction contracts be subject to a minority set-aside requirement. n68 Giving minority business enterprises preferential treatment in bidding for federally-funded contracts was not a novel proposal.  Since 1968 the Small Business Administration, acting under section 8(a) of the Small Business Act of 1953, 15 U.S.C.  \'a7 637(a), had arranged for procurement contracts to be let to minority firms without any requirement of competitive bidding.  The contracts let in this manner involved thousands of minority firms and hundreds of millions of dollars. n69 Other federal agencies maintained various programs setting minimum levels of minority contractor participation. n70 The committee draft of the 1977 Public Works Act already contained a set-aside provision, reserving 2 1/2* of the funds for public works projects for "Indian \b \i0 \ul0 [*31]\b0 \i0 \ul0   tribes and Alaska Native Villages." n71 In proposing utilization of this approach, Congressman Mitchell and Senator Brooke emphasized that it had long been used by the federal government, n72 and that specifying the portion of government contracts to be so set aside was already a common practice among state governments. n73 Thus, when Congress adopted the MBE provision to achieve its purposes, it invoked not a radical and unprecedented solution, but a well-established device with which both the federal and state governments had substantial experience.

If, as petitioners suggest, Congress can only adopt race- conscious remedies after exhaustive committee hearings and detailed committee reports, then Congress would be powerless to address such racial issues during an economic or other crisis.  It is inconceivable that the Fourteenth Amendment compels such a conclusion.  When that Amendment was adopted, congressional hearings were infrequent and committee reports were often perfunctory.  Constitutional constraints on congressional procedures are spelled out expressly in Article I, which requires neither hearings nor reports, but only a majority vote of both houses to adopt legislation. n74 It would be inconsistent with the separation of powers for this Court to impose on Congress other more detailed rules for the fashioning of legislation.  Congress regularly adds and deletes billions of dollars from the federal budget on the floor of the House or Senate based on debates compared to which the instant legislative \b \i0 \ul0 [*33]\b0 \i0 \ul0   history is fulsome.  Momentous legislation often comes into being as a floor amendment; the 1968 fair housing legislation, for example, was adopted by the Senate as an amendment to a bill dealing primarily with riots, Indian rights, and violent interference with federally protected activities.  Congressional committees have been both roundly condemned as inefficient and praised as essential n75 and cogent arguments could doubtless be made for increasing or decreasing their role, but that is a matter confided to the discretion of the Congress.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The purposes which prompted Congress to adopt the MBE provision were clearly articulated on the floors of both the House and the Senate.  Because of the time constraints noted above, little information was available about the administration of the 1976 Public Works Act in particular, and Congress relied primarily on its knowledge of the general practices of contracting officials and federal contractors.  The dismal record that had been compiled by those past practices had been the subject of repeated reports by or to the Congress, and was a record with which the Congress was quite familiar.  No reason appeared then or since to believe that the administration of the 1976 Public Works Act had been significantly better than that general record, and the petitioners do not assert that Congress was not justified in relying on the broader record.

In 1971 and 1972 the subcommittee on Minority Small Business Enterprise of the House Small Business Committee conducted extensive hearings \b \i0 \ul0 [*36]\b0 \i0 \ul0   on the obstacles facing minority businessmen.  It concluded that the obstacles had their roots in past racial discrimination.  "These problems, which are economic in nature, are the result of past social standards which linger as characteristics of minorities as a group." H. Rep. 92-1615, p. 3.  The "long history of racial bias" to which minorities had been subjected invariably led, it found, to the lack of capital and experience which seriously handicapped the efforts of minority entrepreneurs.  Id. at 3-4.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In 1975 that House subcommittee again conducted several days of hearings on this subject, and found the continuing problems of minority businesses to have the same origin.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The effect of past inequities stemming from racial prejudice have not remained in the past.  The Congress has recognized the reality that past discriminatory practices have, to some degree, adversely affected our present economic system.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 While minority persons comprise about 16 percent of the Nation's population, of the 13 million businesses in the United States, only 382,000, or approximately 3.0 percent, are owned by minority individuals.  The most recent data from the Department of Commerce also indicates \b \i0 \ul0 [*37]\b0 \i0 \ul0   that the gross receipts of all businesses in this country totals about $ 2,540.8 billion, and of this amount only $ 16.6 billion, or about 0.65 percent was realized by minority business concerns.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 These statistics are not the result of random chance.  The presumption must be made that past discriminatory systems have resulted in the present economic inequities. n80

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The subcommittee reiterated that conclusion on January 3, 1977, two years later:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The very basic problem disclosed by the testimony is that, over the years, there has developed a business system which has traditionally excluded measurable minority participation.  In the past more than the present, this system of conducting business transactions overtly precluded minority input.  Currently, we more often encounter a business system which is racially neutral on its face, but because of past overt social and economic discrimination is presently operating, in effect, to perpetuate these past inequities. n81

Report of the Task Force on Education and Training for Minority Business Enterprise, p. 17 (1974) ("Decades of prejudice, poor educational opportunity, limited access to real management positions within American business and industry have conspired to restrict the entry of minorities into the mainstream of the nation's free enterprise system.")

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 This latter report was issued less than two months before the adoption of the MBE provision by the House.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 To eliminate the continuing effects on minority businesses of past discrimination, the federal government had adopted over 100 programs to aid minority businesses.  These programs included financial, marketing and business management assistance. n82 But despite the substantial federal efforts to create and sustain minority businesses, those firms received less than one percent of all federal contracts.  Congressman Mitchell argued that such contracting practices were frustrating federal policy:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 We spend a great deal of Federal money under the SBA program creating, strengthening and supporting minority businesses and yet when it comes down to giving those minority businesses a piece of the action, the Federal Government is absolutely remiss.  All it does is say that, "We will create you on the one hand and, on the other hand, we will deny you." That denial is made absolutely clear when one looks at the amount of contracts let in any given fiscal year and then one looks at the percentage of minority contracts. n83 . . . . [W]e approve a budget for OMBE [Office of Minority \b \i0 \ul0 [*39]\b0 \i0 \ul0   Business Enterprise], we approve a budget for the SBA, and we approve other budgets to run those minority enterprises, to make them become viable entities in our system, but then on the other hand we say no, they are cut off from contracts.

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Mitchell urged that legislation mandating that contracts be awarded to minorities were needed because "every agency of the Government has tried to figure out a way to avoid doing this very thing." n84 The United States Commission on Civil Rights had reported to Congress less than two years before that minority-owned firms faced a serious problem of intentional discrimination because "[g]overnment contracting officers expressed biases against minority firms.  . . ." n85

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Thus the MBE provision was adopted and needed to overcome both ongoing discrimination and the continuing effects of \b \i0 \ul0 [*40]\b0 \i0 \ul0   past discrimination.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 (2) Reducing Black Unemployment
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The central focus of the hearings and debate regarding the 1977 Public Works Act was the need to assure better targeting of the construction funds to areas of high unemployment.  The hearings indicated that funds had too often gone to affluent white areas with little, if any, unemployment.  This was not only unfair, but economically unsound, since increased demand for labor in areas of low unemployment was likely to be inflationary.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Senator Brooke urged that the MBE provision was an important way to insure "moneys are properly targeted." n86

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 It is an appropriate concept because minority business' work forces are principally drawn from residents of communities with severe and chronic unemployment.  With more business, these firms can hire even more minority citizens.  Only with a healthy, vital minority business sector can we hope to make dramatic strides in our fight against the massive and chronic unemployment which plagues throughout this country. n87

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Congressman Biaggi, arguing in a similar vein, noted that unemployment among minority groups \b \i0 \ul0 [*41]\b0 \i0 \ul0   was running "as high as 35 percent", and that the amendment was needed to avoid "potential inequities to . . . workers" and would provide "great benefit to the entire minority community." n88

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 Congress' concern about minority unemployment was well founded.  In January, 1977, unemployment was 12.7% among non-whites, compared to 6.8% among whites. n89 By March of that year white unemployment was falling while non-white unemployment was actually rising. n90 Teenage unemployment exceeded 36% among non-whites, over twice the rate among white teenagers. n91 The history and magnitude of discrimination against minorities in the construction industries was well-documented and well-known. n92 Congress was justifiably concerned that a federal spending program involving construction was especially likely to afford a disproportionately small number of jobs to minorities among whom unemployment was the highest.  The proportion of minority employees in minority- owned firms is substantially higher than in white-owned firms. n93 Under these circumstances Congress properly resorted to "targeting" minority businesses as a method of targeting \b \i0 \ul0 [*42]\b0 \i0 \ul0   unemployed minorities.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 The petitioners urge that the MBE provision must be struck down because it was not the "least onerous" method of achieving Congress' purposes. n94 No such requirement, in our view, is imposed by the Constitution on benign racial classifications.  Moreover, no reason appears to characterize the MBE provision as less "onerous" than the alternatives pressed by petitioners, such as cash advances to minority contractors. n95 If such alternatives \b \i0 \ul0 [*43]\b0 \i0 \ul0   were successful, they would still result in recipient minority businessmen winning contracts, and white businessmen losing them, because of the race of each.  The effect on the losing bidder would be no less substantial, but only less overt.

\par \fs20 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi360 In any event, Congress clearly believed that only the MBE clause would suffice to achieve its purposes.  Representative Mitchell argued that set-asides were "the only way we are going to get minority enterprises into our system". n96 Senator Brooke urged the provision was necessary because minority businesses have received only 1 percent of the Federal contract dollar, despite repeated legislation, Executive Orders, and regulations mandating affirmative efforts to include minority contractors in the Federal contracts pool. n97

It was too late for new training or aid for minority enterprises to have any impact, and there was no time to set up or operate any complex administrative machinery.  The 10% set- aside program was indeed far more effective than the earlier programs, channeling more contract dollars to minority businesses in a few months than they had received in 10 years under the section 8(a) program of the Small Business Administration. n101

Neither the Constitution nor considerations of public policy compelled the latter course.
